Most would agree that writing is an essential skill to refine, and I think the best way to for me to do that is to cover topics which I'm passionate about.</p>\n<p>The process of writing things down requires clear thinking, so covering familiar topics will enforce a certain rigor, and perhaps expose some faulty assumptions. Writing a blog post on an unfamiliar topic will be a ideal way to explore, then codify and share my learning.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>To have a public platform where I can share thoughts, experiences, and learning</strong></p>\n<p>I love the idea that you could read my blog and find something useful, whether it be a tutorial for some new technology or a new technique for learning.</p>\n<p>I hope that my experiences will reflect yours, and my thinking will resonate with you. If you learn a fraction of what I do through writing the posts I'll judge it a great success!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>To display and keep a record of all the exciting things I learn about tech</strong></p>\n<p>One of the things I love about technology is that there is always more to learn. There are endless opportunities to read, practice, and use new concepts every day. It will be a sad day if I ever stop learning, so I strive to explore fresh ideas constantly.</p>\n<p>While this blog may serve as an impartial record of my journey through life and the tech industry, I hope it will also be useful to demonstrate my passion for technology.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What can you expect from this blog?</h2>\n<p>At this stage, the exact contents of future posts is still undecided. Everything I write will keep the above principles in mind, so you can expect the majority of posts will be somewhat technology-related. If there's a specific topic you'd like me to cover, please feel free to reach out with suggestions and feedback!</p>\n<p>I hope the form and tone of my writing will develop into a warmer, more conversational style over the coming months - perhaps it will change drastically as I get a clearer idea of the audience and the writing style I'm most comfortable with.</p>\n<p>I'm planning to post at least once a month; this seems like a reasonable cadence to ensure I continue to meet the aims above.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>\n<h2>Technical setup - Blog 1.0</h2>\n<h3>Static site generation</h3>\n<p>Currently I'm using <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/\">Hugo</a> to generate a static website. Hugo is a fantastic cross-platform static site generator tool built in Go. I recently dipped my toe into Django too, and I really enjoyed how my knowledge of <a href=\"http://handlebarsjs.com/\">Handlebars</a> templating  crosses over to both python and Go.</p>\n<p>I found it incredibly easy to get up and running with a local server, and love how simply running <code>hugo server</code> sets up automatic server restarts when a file changes, and live reload  in the browser every time that happens.</p>\n<p>I also considered GitHub's offering in this space, <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a>, and to be honest, there wasn't much in it. Hugo's slighly more beginner-friendly docs swung it for me. I'll definitely consider migrating in the future, especially since Jekyll is so closely integrated with GitHub pages. The technical implementation of the blog will evolve along with the writing!</p>\n<p>Once I've learned more about Hugo I'll probably write a more in-depth post - I'm also hoping to contribute to the project on GitHub in the near future.</p>\n<h3>Design &#x26; Writing</h3>\n<p>The look and feel of the blog is currently based on the <a href=\"https://github.com/tmaiaroto/hugo-redlounge\">hugo-redlounge</a> theme - I made a few simplifications and style modifications (for example adding a picture next to each post), but the structure is largely unedited. Using a theme has been an ideal way to get up and running quickly - I prioritised content creation over having a perfectly styled site. The design will be an iterative process, making small modifications and additions as I go along - look out for updates!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://typora.io/\">Typora</a> is an amazing, minimal Markdown editor for writing posts in the flow, without distractions. The best part is it renders style <strong>as you write</strong>, meaning there is only a single window! All the markdown editors I've used previously have two - one for text entry and one for previewing your document.</p>\n<h3>Build process &#x26; Hosting</h3>\n<p>I chose to use <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">GitHub Pages</a> to host this blog initially, mainly due to fact that it's free, but also because Git is a tool I'm very familiar with, Pages integrates seamlessly into my workflow.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.christophvoigt.com/setting-up-hugo-with-github-pages/\">This blog post</a> was invaluable in setting up a quick and easy CI process - I simply <code>git push</code> to the 'source' branch of my GitHub pages repository, and thanks to the magic of <a href=\"https://travis-ci.org/\">Travis CI</a>, my changes are live within ~30 seconds.</p>\n<p>Overall, hosting and CI was one of the sections that's taken the least work so far, since I was pretty happy with the setup 'out of the box'.</p>",timeToRead:4,frontmatter:{date:"October 28, 2016",path:"/promulgation",tags:["react","gatsby","static site","meta"],title:"Promulgation"}},responsiveImage:{responsiveSizes:{aspectRatio:1.5,base64:"data:image/jpeg;base64,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",src:"/blog/static/0962425a5f1174a5b392e7e89b142d80-7da9d.jpg",srcSet:"/blog/static/0962425a5f1174a5b392e7e89b142d80-e49f3.jpg 200w,\n/blog/static/0962425a5f1174a5b392e7e89b142d80-5758d.jpg 400w,\n/blog/static/0962425a5f1174a5b392e7e89b142d80-7da9d.jpg 800w,\n/blog/static/0962425a5f1174a5b392e7e89b142d80-936f0.jpg 1200w,\n/blog/static/0962425a5f1174a5b392e7e89b142d80-13920.jpg 1600w,\n/blog/static/0962425a5f1174a5b392e7e89b142d80-4950d.jpg 2400w,\n/blog/static/0962425a5f1174a5b392e7e89b142d80-124c2.jpg 3456w",sizes:"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}},pathContext:{prev:{html:"<p>I'm currently on a year in industry, working at Eli Lilly and Company in Basingstoke. As part of my degree, I take a year to out to work, giving me invaluable experience, but also giving me time and space to figure out my ideal career path. In this post I'll talk about the first few weeks there and the process of settling in.</p>\n<p>This is my first entry into the corporate world, previous jobs having been at much smaller companies.</p>\n<p>There was so much take in at the beginning: business skills, information about the company, names and faces - never mind the technology! I feel like a lot of this was tacit knowledge, particularly the unwritten rules and expectations that came with being a new intern.</p>\n<h3>Initial Pressure</h3>\n<p>It didn't help that the student I was replacing, Tom, was one of the best in his cohort. He did an amazing job helping me to find my feet, but hearing him recount his accomplishments often made me think 'how could I ever come close?'.</p>\n<p>A new graduate, Alex, started in our team at the same time as I did. Our skillsets were (are?) quite different, so I don't think we felt too much competition, but there was an unavoidable element of comparison. In hindsight, this was a good thing, because it made me hold myself to a higher standard, but in the early days it added another facet to the pressure!</p>\n<p>One of the scariest things Tom and Alex 'suggested' I do was run a 'lunch and learn' - present a topic of my choice at a lunchtime. The audience was mainly the new students, which was a relief in the way that no higher-ups were there, but of course I didn't want to look like an idiot in from of my peers!</p>\n<p>Looking back, this was probably the single most valuable thing for increasing my confidence, and gaining exposure - thanks guys.</p>\n<h3>Information overload</h3>\n<p>Along with the 'big shoes to fill', there was an vast amount of incoming information. From company mission through departmental responsibilities all the way to individual roles, it was definitely a case of 'death by powerpoint'.</p>\n<p>A big issue was the number of abbreviations and jargon thrown around. Most people probably don't realise they do it, and it certainly speeds up information transfer once everyone knows them, but it increased the initial learning curve dramatically.</p>\n<p>It may not be immediately obvious, but learning so many names and faces at once was also a challenge. With all the other info being fired at me, I sometimes had to ask for introductions more than once.</p>\n<h3>Tech learning curve</h3>\n<p>Fortunately, the tech learning curve wasn't as steep initially - at least in the first week or two. I started off with a fairly simple project - developing an anonymous online forum for employees to raise questions with senior management. I chose to use PHP, since that was the web language I was most familiar with. However, I soon ran into some hurdles - developing behind the corporate proxy was one, working on a windows machine another. It took a while to get my environment set up similar enough to the Macbook I'd been using for the past 5+ years, but thanks to <a href=\"http://cmder.net/\">Cmder</a>, <a href=\"https://atom.io/\">Atom</a> and the <code>http_proxy</code> environment variable I eventually got into the groove.</p>\n<p>I was also blazing a trail with some of my work on OpenShift. A decent part of my role focuses on setting up this internal PaaS as a production service, so I was deploying apps, writing scripts, and integrating with databases - things that our customers wanted but no-one had attempted before. This was amazing fun, but did lead to some days of frustration when the environment was unstable.</p>\n<p>While a large part of my dayjob remained working on OpenShift, I quickly moved on to learn new web technologies and new platforms - check my post where I tell the story of [how I learned Node.js and ran a 90-minute webinar in one week]!</p>\n<h3>Now</h3>\n<p>I'd say it took me 3-4 months to feel fully comfortable in my role, and ramp up to full speed. That isn't to stay I stopped learning - every day brings a fresh challenge.</p>\n<p>Comparing myself now to myself at the start of the year, I'm amazed. My confidence has been vastly increased, my technical abilities have come on in leaps and bounds, and my business skills are also much better. It's been a great year so far, and I think I've built a fantastic foundation to continue learning and growing. Here's to the rest of the year and the future!</p>",id:"/Users/matt/Documents/code/gatsby-blog-starter-kit/src/pages/2016-12-05-assimiliation/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/Users/matt/Documents/code/gatsby-blog-starter-kit/src/pages/2016-12-05-assimiliation/index.md",timeToRead:3,frontmatter:{date:"2016-12-05T13:35:13.234Z",path:"/assimilation",tags:["placement","lilly"],title:"Assimilation",summary:"Entering a Fortune 500 company and the corporate world"}},next:!1}}}});
