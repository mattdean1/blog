I worked as part of a small team on this, with a few people in the US and a few in the UK.</p>\n<p>One of the tools we created was a metrics dashboard with charts showing usage information about the platform. For MVP we built this as a Django monolith, which was fine to get something out the door, but it was difficult to coordinate across timezones, since half the team was in the UK and half in the US. Our skillsets were also segregated, with the experienced Django developers sitting in the US whereas the UK team members were more comfortable with Node.js.</p>\n<p>I identified that a microservices architecture would be a better fit for this project so each subteam could develop more independently. We also liked the idea of some of the other advantages of a service-oriented architecture, like independent release schedules and the ability to choose the most suitable stack for each part of the application.</p>\n<h2>The app</h2>\n<h3>MVP 1</h3>\n<p>The Django MVP of our app was pretty basic, hitting the OpenShift API and parsing that data on every page load. We passed that parsed data into the HTML templates and rendered some tables and charts. This did satisfy the baseline requirements of showing management and ourselves the customer uptake of OpenShift, but it had some flaws, first and foremost, page load time. As more customers started checking the dashboard, we also put strain on the OpenShift API, particularly in our Proof-of-Concept environment, where resources are limited.</p>\n<h3>MVP 2</h3>\n<p>Since a lot of the data parsing logic was already implemented in Python, we decided to keep a Django-based backend, but convert it to a RESTful API. During this period we learned a lot about the tradeoffs during API development, and why an API-centric approach to software development can be so powerful in enabling internal collaboration.</p>\n<p>See Jeff Bezos' 'API Mandate' at Amazon in the early 2000's  - he mandated that all employees must develop services in order to share information between teams, i.e. the only way to get access to other internal data was through an API. This edict was transformational to the way Amazon employees worked, and the way the company was structured internally, arguably a big factor in enabling Amazon to go from an online bookstore to the enormous e-commerce and cloud computing platform it is today.</p>\n<p>For the frontend I chose to go with React, hosted on a Node server. These were technologies I had a fair bit of previous experience with, and the dashboard was a good fit for the component-oriented architecture of React app, since we had a similar dataset for all 3 of our OpenShift environments, hence often 3 charts displaying the same kind of data.</p>\n<h2>Wrangling Django</h2>\n<p>For MVP2, converting the backend to return JSON wasn't crazily difficult. We already passed some data into our templates, so we could get a basic response going by returning a <code>django.http JsonResponse</code> instead of <code>render</code>ing a template. Of course this didn't give us a true RESTful API, but for a couple of <code>GET</code> endpoints it did the job.</p>\n<p>One issue I ran into was attempting to serialize our Django objects - when passing an object into a template file you can use Django Classes just fine, but as soon as I tried to serialize these into JSON up popped a whole bunch of errors. Fortunately, out of the box Django provides serialization into JSON as long as you use a <code>Model</code> rather than a <code>Class</code>. Converting our classes to models was relatively straightforward and essentially required me to specify some detail about each field like datatype, length, etc..</p>\n<p>Later, as we built out our API interfacing between OpenShift and our frontend, and we needed more endpoints, especially <code>POST</code>/<code>PUT</code>, we moved to use <a href=\"http://www.django-rest-framework.org/\">Django REST Framework</a> (DRF). DRF is actually a really nice tool, and gives you a lot of features 'for free' as you build an API, like making your API browsable, and easy integration with OAuth. Next time I build an API I'd probably check out something like <a href=\"https://swagger.io/\">Swagger</a>, or explore using a statically typed or functional language like Go or Elixir in the backend.</p>\n<h2>Juggling Javascript</h2>\n<p>I built the frontend in React, using the <a href=\"https://react.semantic-ui.com/introduction\">semantic-ui-react</a> framework, and <a href=\"https://github.com/reactjs/react-chartjs\">react-chartjs</a>. These frameworks made it easy to create a responsive site, and I created some nice pure chart components. The one hurdle I had to watch out for was to get the data from our API in the correct React lifecycle method - I ended up using <code>fetch</code> inside <code>componentDidMount</code>. Sadly Internet Explorer is the default browser at work, so to support that I had to import the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/whatwg-fetch\">whatwg-fetch</a> polyfill.</p>\n<h3>Caching</h3>\n<p>One of the main drawbacks of MVP1 was the page load time, since we fetched data from the OpenShift API on every page load. To try and address this, I decided to add some caching to our app, which happened at a few different layers. I tackled the following bullet points one-by-one, benchmarking page load times at each step.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Since I'm most familiar with Node, I wrote a short cron job using <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-cron\">node-cron</a>, which regularly copied the OpenShift API responses verbatim into redis. Of course I had to edit our backend to consume the cache instead of getting data from OpenShift directly, using <a href=\"https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py\">redis-py</a>.</li>\n<li>This sped up page load times a fair bit, but the data parsing step was still happening on every refresh, since only the raw OpenShift API responses were in redis, not the collated data. So, I added to my cron job - I stored <em>our</em> Django API responses in redis too. After editing the backend again to retrieve the <em>parsed data</em> from redis where possible, this meant page load times were considerably decreased.</li>\n<li>The one 'gotcha' here is that if our API returned its values from the redis cache, how would we update the cache with new values? I set the redis expiry time to be a little lower than the cron frequency, which meant that new results would be computed every time the cron job ran.</li>\n<li>Of course, if redis was down, would that bring down our entire API? No, because if a key did not exist (it had expired or redis was down), I would fall back to parsing the data and/or getting data directly from OpenShift.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Further Improvements and takeaways</h2>\n<p>As mentioned previously, we later moved our Django API over to Django Rest Framework, which gave us a lot more reliability and the ability to plug in a Postgres database, which meant we could store historical data too.</p>\n<p>The best part about this migration to DRF was that we didn't have to change the frontend - perhaps we changed what endpoint we hit via an environment variable, but we could pretty much leave the frontend alone since it was a separate service.</p>\n<p>Overall this was a fantastic project which really hammered home the value of service oriented architecture and made me realise that designing an API is harder than it looks! I've been using the GitHub GraphQL API in another project, which is a lot of fun and seems especially powerful for mobile apps.</p>",id:"/Users/matt/Documents/code/gatsby-blog-starter-kit/src/pages/2017-06-15-bifurcate/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/Users/matt/Documents/code/gatsby-blog-starter-kit/src/pages/2017-06-15-bifurcate/index.md",timeToRead:5,frontmatter:{date:"2017-06-15T11:34:03+01:00",path:"/bifurcate",tags:["lilly","javascript","react","python","django","API"],title:"Bifurcate",summary:"Converting a Django monolith to microservices: a REST API and a React frontend"}},{html:'<p>This post details how I went from knowing zero Node.js to running a 90 minute webinar on it in less than a week! To summarise, I introduced a new recruitment hackathon stream using Node.js, which increased the number of applications by <strong>25%</strong>. The students using the new platform (all of whom I also mentored), made up <strong>55%</strong> of the candidates invited to interview.</p>\n<p>The junior developer recruitment process at Eli Lilly consists of a week-long online hackathon, followed by on-site interviews. During the time I applied, the development language used for the hack was restricted to Salesforce.com.</p>\n<p>The conversion rate of applicants was fairly low for my intake, with a number of applicants failing to submit at the end of the hackathon. After consideration, and talking to some colleagues who went through this process, I spotted an opportunity to improve the number of applicants and their conversion rate.</p>\n<p>The key issue was the lack of flexibility - Salesforce is a useful platform, and experience with Java can transfer well, but for those with prior experience in web development the limitations could be frustrating. Any new platform added also needed to have a free trial, and be accessible to those with little/no experience.</p>\n<h2>Choosing the platform</h2>\n<p>Node.js on Heroku seemed like a good choice of language and platform due to its plethora of packages (allowing applicants to add complex functionality quickly), wide usage within Lilly (giving us expertise to lean on for judging), and easy integration with other free tools like GitHub.</p>\n<p>A number of tasks had to be completed before offering this application stream to the next set of applicants:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An example application submission to demonstrate the quality of work expected</li>\n<li>Detailed mark scheme / scoring criteria</li>\n<li>Training video(s) to get those with little previous experience up to speed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I therefore decided to simulate the hackathon process end to end using our new framework. This way I could test it out and see if it would be possible for someone who didn\'t know Node to produce something comparable to those choosing the Salesforce path.</p>\n<p>One of our graduate developers who had previous experience with Node created the scoring criteria, and off I went!</p>\n<h2>Learning Node and ideation</h2>\n<p>Step one was to learn Node.js. I collected plenty of resources - software, articles, and tutorials, then began to work through them. One particularly useful tool was <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html">express-generator</a>, which creates a barebones Node.js/Express app filestructure.</p>\n<p>I then had to think of an idea. As part of the hackathon, we provide applicants with some \'challenges\' to help with the ideation phase. These take the form of quite general problems related to healthcare, for example encouraging diabetics to exercise, or distributing food around the world.</p>\n<p>The idea I settled on was to help distribute supplies to those affected by a natural disaster. <a href="https://github.com/mattdean1/quake-supply">Quake-supply</a> intends to track supplies distributed through field outposts after an earthquake.</p>\n<h2>Example submission</h2>\n<p>I created my sample app over a couple of days, learning more about Node along the way.</p>\n<p>I pull live data from the US Geological Survey API to get the coordinates and magnitude of the most recent earthquakes, and use <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet.js</a> for mapping. I also used <a href="http://t4t5.github.io/sweetalert/">SweetAlert</a> and <a href="https://datatables.net/">DataTables</a> to help make it look presentable.</p>\n<p>Once the app was finished, I recorded a <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwAduYXoO8I">video</a></strong> explaining the idea, the app, and how I created it.</p>\n<h2>Webinar</h2>\n<p>I ran a live webinar to give the students more information about the hackathon, show them how to get started on the platform, and give them a chance to ask questions. There was a separate webinar run for the Salesforce stream so for this one I was on my own - after a brief introduction by the sponsor of the program, it was down to me. Here\'s the structure of the content I presented:</p>\n<h4>Tools</h4>\n<p>First, I thought it\'d be a good idea to introduce the students to some of the key tooling and the platform. For this webinar I had to assume they had no previous web development experience, so it was difficult to strike a balance between being high-level and detailed.</p>\n<p>I gave a quick rundown of GitHub, PaaS, Heroku, Atom, and express-generator.</p>\n<h4>CRUD through a todo app</h4>\n<p>Secondly, I introduced the Connect, Request, Update, and Delete operations on a Node/Mongo stack by creating a basic todo app. I generated the file structure using express-generator and explained each folder, then got straight into coding.</p>\n<p>I used a pre-prepared webpage with code snippets (GitHub Gists) so those viewing the webinar could code along live or with the recording. My app was also regularly deployed and live on Heroku throughout the webinar.</p>\n<p>The tutorial was roughly split up into four sections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Setup, first push, importing a CSS framework</li>\n<li>Display Todos, create new Todos</li>\n<li>Add a database</li>\n<li>Delete a todo, tick off a todo</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Scoring and Submission</h4>\n<p>Lastly, I ran through what we were looking for in a successful submission, with particular attention to the format of the submission video.</p>\n<p>I also talked about the scoring criteria and gave my final tips and tricks for succeeding in the hackathon. The webinar ended with Q and A, giving candidates valuable time to clarify anything they didn\'t understand.</p>\n<h4>Result</h4>\n<p>After the webinar, I made available on the Facebook group the list of resources I curated, the Todo app repository, the snippet webpage, and a recording of the entire thing.</p>\n<p>I got great feedback from the applicants and my colleagues, who said it was extremely clear and everything was well explained.</p>\n<h2>Mentoring</h2>\n<p>I was allocated all 6 students who chose to use Node/Heroku to mentor through the process. This consisted of encouraging them via facebook and email, and answering any questions they had about the application process or about the technology. Over the week I supported them as best as I could, and got some positive \'thankyou\' responses, but the real feedback came when it was time for judging.</p>\n<p>Myself, some other developers, and some more technically minded management came together to score the submissions and decide which candidates should be invited on-site for an interview.</p>\n<p>I was unbelievably pleased that my mentees made up <strong>55%</strong> (5 out of 9) of the interview candidates! This is likely due to a combination of factors, but I think their use of the Node/Heroku was key, as it allowed them to quickly create advanced functionality.</p>\n<h2>Continued use of Node.js</h2>\n<p>Learning Node.js was a key milestone in my journey as web developer, and I\'ve gone on to use it in a number of apps at work, also becoming the nominal Node.js consultant for our internal PaaS service.</p>\n<p>Example projects I used it in include: an <a href="https://github.com/mattdean1/nodejs-oidc-client-example">OpenID Connect accelerator</a>, a number of metrics dashboards (in combination with <a href="http://www.chartjs.org/">Chart.js</a>), and <a href="https://github.com/mattdean1/reMINDer">a reminder system for people with Alzheimer\'s</a>.</p>\n<p>I\'m currently learning React and Webpack by using them for a couple of projects in work, and although the outcome may not be as dramatic, I hope to write a post featuring these technologies soon.</p>',id:"/Users/matt/Documents/code/gatsby-blog-starter-kit/src/pages/2017-01-17-metamorphosis/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/Users/matt/Documents/code/gatsby-blog-starter-kit/src/pages/2017-01-17-metamorphosis/index.md",timeToRead:5,frontmatter:{date:"2017-01-17T20:39:38Z",path:"/metamorphosis",tags:["lilly","nodejs","javascript"],title:"Metamorphosis",summary:"How I went from knowing nothing about Node.js to running a 90 minute webinar in less than a week"}},{html:"<p>I'm currently on a year in industry, working at Eli Lilly and Company in Basingstoke. As part of my degree, I take a year to out to work, giving me invaluable experience, but also giving me time and space to figure out my ideal career path. In this post I'll talk about the first few weeks there and the process of settling in.</p>\n<p>This is my first entry into the corporate world, previous jobs having been at much smaller companies.</p>\n<p>There was so much take in at the beginning: business skills, information about the company, names and faces - never mind the technology! I feel like a lot of this was tacit knowledge, particularly the unwritten rules and expectations that came with being a new intern.</p>\n<h3>Initial Pressure</h3>\n<p>It didn't help that the student I was replacing, Tom, was one of the best in his cohort. He did an amazing job helping me to find my feet, but hearing him recount his accomplishments often made me think 'how could I ever come close?'.</p>\n<p>A new graduate, Alex, started in our team at the same time as I did. Our skillsets were (are?) quite different, so I don't think we felt too much competition, but there was an unavoidable element of comparison. In hindsight, this was a good thing, because it made me hold myself to a higher standard, but in the early days it added another facet to the pressure!</p>\n<p>One of the scariest things Tom and Alex 'suggested' I do was run a 'lunch and learn' - present a topic of my choice at a lunchtime. The audience was mainly the new students, which was a relief in the way that no higher-ups were there, but of course I didn't want to look like an idiot in from of my peers!</p>\n<p>Looking back, this was probably the single most valuable thing for increasing my confidence, and gaining exposure - thanks guys.</p>\n<h3>Information overload</h3>\n<p>Along with the 'big shoes to fill', there was an vast amount of incoming information. From company mission through departmental responsibilities all the way to individual roles, it was definitely a case of 'death by powerpoint'.</p>\n<p>A big issue was the number of abbreviations and jargon thrown around. Most people probably don't realise they do it, and it certainly speeds up information transfer once everyone knows them, but it increased the initial learning curve dramatically.</p>\n<p>It may not be immediately obvious, but learning so many names and faces at once was also a challenge. With all the other info being fired at me, I sometimes had to ask for introductions more than once.</p>\n<h3>Tech learning curve</h3>\n<p>Fortunately, the tech learning curve wasn't as steep initially - at least in the first week or two. I started off with a fairly simple project - developing an anonymous online forum for employees to raise questions with senior management. I chose to use PHP, since that was the web language I was most familiar with. However, I soon ran into some hurdles - developing behind the corporate proxy was one, working on a windows machine another. It took a while to get my environment set up similar enough to the Macbook I'd been using for the past 5+ years, but thanks to <a href=\"http://cmder.net/\">Cmder</a>, <a href=\"https://atom.io/\">Atom</a> and the <code>http_proxy</code> environment variable I eventually got into the groove.</p>\n<p>I was also blazing a trail with some of my work on OpenShift. A decent part of my role focuses on setting up this internal PaaS as a production service, so I was deploying apps, writing scripts, and integrating with databases - things that our customers wanted but no-one had attempted before. This was amazing fun, but did lead to some days of frustration when the environment was unstable.</p>\n<p>While a large part of my dayjob remained working on OpenShift, I quickly moved on to learn new web technologies and new platforms - check my post where I tell the story of [how I learned Node.js and ran a 90-minute webinar in one week]!</p>\n<h3>Now</h3>\n<p>I'd say it took me 3-4 months to feel fully comfortable in my role, and ramp up to full speed. That isn't to stay I stopped learning - every day brings a fresh challenge.</p>\n<p>Comparing myself now to myself at the start of the year, I'm amazed. My confidence has been vastly increased, my technical abilities have come on in leaps and bounds, and my business skills are also much better. It's been a great year so far, and I think I've built a fantastic foundation to continue learning and growing. Here's to the rest of the year and the future!</p>",id:"/Users/matt/Documents/code/gatsby-blog-starter-kit/src/pages/2016-12-05-assimiliation/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/Users/matt/Documents/code/gatsby-blog-starter-kit/src/pages/2016-12-05-assimiliation/index.md",timeToRead:3,frontmatter:{date:"2016-12-05T13:35:13.234Z",path:"/assimilation",tags:["placement","lilly"],title:"Assimilation",summary:"Entering a Fortune 500 company and the corporate world"}}],javascript:[{html:"<p>Over the past year, whilst on placement at Lilly, my main focus was setting up on-premise platform-as-a-service (OpenShift).

Microsoft describes it better than I can:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imagine Cup is a global competition that empowers the next generation of computer science students to team up and use their creativity, passion and knowledge of technology to create applications that shape how we live, work and play. Every year tens of thousands of students from across the globe compete for cash, travel and prizes and for the honor of taking home the Imagine Cup!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My flatmate, Wilson, found out about the competition - after he told me and one of his friends from Uni, Sam, we decided to give it a go. Little did we know we'd make it all the way to the national finals!</p>\n<h2>Our Product</h2>\n<p>After an extensive brainstorming session resulting in many crumpled pieces of paper, we drew inspiration from the then-recently released Wetherspoons app. Their app allows you to order and pay for food and drink from your table - no more waiting at the bar!</p>\n<p>We loved the convenience and thought it'd be great to have this ability at every restaurant or bar. Some market research showed that while some large chains (McDonald's, Wagamamas) recently released apps with similar functionality, no solution existed for independent businesses, or even small to medium size chains.</p>\n<p>So, we chose to create a customer purchase and ordering platform for independent restaurants and bars:</p>\n<p>Onboarding businesses had to be as streamlined as possible, so we created a simple sign-up form, followed by a drag-and-drop web interface for the owner to create their menu. Each menu has a unique QR code for the owner to display e.g. on tables. The owner can log back in at any time to update prices or availability of menu items, which will be instantly reflected in the menu the customer sees.</p>\n<p>The customer scans the QR (or enters the menu ID on our website) and is taken directly to a mobile-optimized webapp where they can see what's on offer and add items to their basket. The customer can then submit their order and pay through PayPal - performing the entire transaction without downloading an app or creating an account!</p>\n<p>Once confirmed, the order goes straight through to a touchscreen (which could be a cheap android tablet) in the kitchen/bar for staff to fulfill. Staff can tap the screen to check orders off once they're completed and keep track of the status.</p>\n<h3>Advantages</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The customer receives their order without leaving their seat!</li>\n<li>Restaurant can reduce front of house staff</li>\n<li>Bar can reduce average wait time</li>\n<li>Front of house staff can focus on what really matters - providing an exceptional customer experience</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Tech</h2>\n<p>The frontend of the app was written in Node.js and Express. We used these technologies since we all had experience with them - for this project we decided we should focus on delivering a great product, and there was still plenty to learn since we were new to the Azure platform.</p>\n<p>We got Azure credit as part of the competition, so it made sense to use Microsoft's platform to host our Node app - we also used an MSSQL database and Azure Redis for caching. I quite enjoyed using Azure - it's becoming difficult to see the differentiation between GCP, AWS, and Azure for basic hosting like this. I think to choose between platforms I'd probably consider pricing first, and for simplicity go with the platform on which I was already using less common functionality like AWS Lambda.</p>\n<h2>The UK finals</h2>\n<p>We submitted a short video pitch and our business plan. After a couple of weeks we got a very exciting email: we were through to the UK finals! The final took place at Microsoft's London offices, where we were given the opportunity to present to such dignitaries as the CTO of Microsoft Accelerator, their Principal Tech Evangelist, and the Director of Azure for Research.</p>\n<p>It was an amazing day, with sessions on entrepreneurship and tons of advice on how to start and scale a business. We got great feedback on our product - the judges highlighted our customer focus and real potential to disrupt the hospitality industry. Unfortunately we didn't make it through to the next stage of the competition, but I had a great time working with Wilson and Sam, and we all learned a lot technically, as well as about creating a startup.</p>\n<p>Some feedback from the judges:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Could definitely see this taking off\"</li>\n<li>\"Slick presentation\"</li>\n<li>\"You've clearly identified and addressed a real problem in this market\"</li>\n<li>\"Solid validation from external stakeholders\"</li>\n</ul>",

After some extensive googling I found this <a href="https://medium.com/pro-react/a-brief-talk-about-immutability-and-react-s-helpers-70919ab8ae7c">super helpful article</a>.</p>\n<h2>It’s a JS problem</h2>\n<p>Objects and arrays are passed by reference in JS. This means that a new copy is not created, and updating the \'new\' object or array actually modifies the original one.</p>\n<p>In this case I couldn\'t use <code>array.concat</code> or similar non-destructive methods, or <code>object.assign</code> as suggested in the article because I am attempting to modify a nested object so JavaScript will always pass by reference.</p>\n<h2>Immutability helper</h2>\n<p>The article I linked earlier references the built-in React Immutability Helpers, however when I visit the suggested <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/update.html">page in the React docs</a>, I find that "<code>update</code> is a legacy add-on. Use <a href="https://github.com/kolodny/immutability-helper">kolodny/immutability-helper instead</a>."</p>\n<p>This is a fantastic little module that allows us to update e.g. a complicated nested state object "without changing how the data is represented". The syntax is similar to mongodb queries, so didn\'t take long to get used to.</p>\n<p>If you\'re running into issues related to the immutability in more than one place in your application, you might want to look into a more full-featured solution like Facebook\'s <a href="https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/">Immutable.js</a>.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>Remembering to import the library,

interesting bug I ran into during the Starling Bank hackathon"}},{html:'<p>This post details how I went from knowing zero Node.js to running a 90 minute webinar on it in less than a week! To summarise, I introduced a new recruitment hackathon stream using Node.js, which increased the number of applications by <strong>25%</strong>. The students using the new platform (all of whom I also mentored), made up <strong>55%</strong> of the candidates invited to interview.</p>\n<p>The junior developer recruitment process at Eli Lilly consists of a week-long online hackathon, followed by on-site interviews. During the time I applied, the development language used for the hack was restricted to Salesforce.com.</p>\n<p>The conversion rate of applicants was fairly low for my intake, with a number of applicants failing to submit at the end of the hackathon. After consideration, and talking to some colleagues who went through this process, I spotted an opportunity to improve the number of applicants and their conversion rate.</p>\n<p>The key issue was the lack of flexibility - Salesforce is a useful platform, and experience with Java can transfer well, but for those with prior experience in web development the limitations could be frustrating. Any new platform added also needed to have a free trial, and be accessible to those with little/no experience.</p>\n<h2>Choosing the platform</h2>\n<p>Node.js on Heroku seemed like a good choice of language and platform due to its plethora of packages (allowing applicants to add complex functionality quickly), wide usage within Lilly (giving us expertise to lean on for judging), and easy integration with other free tools like GitHub.</p>\n<p>A number of tasks had to be completed before offering this application stream to the next set of applicants:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An example application submission to demonstrate the quality of work expected</li>\n<li>Detailed mark scheme / scoring criteria</li>\n<li>Training video(s) to get those with little previous experience up to speed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I therefore decided to simulate the hackathon process end to end using our new framework. This way I could test it out and see if it would be possible for someone who didn\'t know Node to produce something comparable to those choosing the Salesforce path.</p>\n<p>One of our graduate developers who had previous experience with Node created the scoring criteria, and off I went!</p>\n<h2>Learning Node and ideation</h2>\n<p>Step one was to learn Node.js. I collected plenty of resources - software, articles, and tutorials, then began to work through them. One particularly useful tool was <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html">express-generator</a>, which creates a barebones Node.js/Express app filestructure.</p>\n<p>I then had to think of an idea. As part of the hackathon, we provide applicants with some \'challenges\' to help with the ideation phase. These take the form of quite general problems related to healthcare, for example encouraging diabetics to exercise, or distributing food around the world.</p>\n<p>The idea I settled on was to help distribute supplies to those affected by a natural disaster. <a href="https://github.com/mattdean1/quake-supply">Quake-supply</a> intends to track supplies distributed through field outposts after an earthquake.</p>\n<h2>Example submission</h2>\n<p>I created my sample app over a couple of days, learning more about Node along the way.</p>\n<p>I pull live data from the US Geological Survey API to get the coordinates and magnitude of the most recent earthquakes, and use <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet.js</a> for mapping. I also used <a href="http://t4t5.github.io/sweetalert/">SweetAlert</a> and <a href="https://datatables.net/">DataTables</a> to help make it look presentable.</p>\n<p>Once the app was finished, I recorded a <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwAduYXoO8I">video</a></strong> explaining the idea, the app, and how I created it.</p>\n<h2>Webinar</h2>\n<p>I ran a live webinar to give the students more information about the hackathon, show them how to get started on the platform, and give them a chance to ask questions. There was a separate webinar run for the Salesforce stream so for this one I was on my own - after a brief introduction by the sponsor of the program, it was down to me. Here\'s the structure of the content I presented:</p>\n<h4>Tools</h4>\n<p>First, I thought it\'d be a good idea to introduce the students to some of the key tooling and the platform. For this webinar I had to assume they had no previous web development experience, so it was difficult to strike a balance between being high-level and detailed.</p>\n<p>I gave a quick rundown of GitHub, PaaS, Heroku, Atom, and express-generator.</p>\n<h4>CRUD through a todo app</h4>\n<p>Secondly, I introduced the Connect, Request, Update, and Delete operations on a Node/Mongo stack by creating a basic todo app. I generated the file structure using express-generator and explained each folder, then got straight into coding.</p>\n<p>I used a pre-prepared webpage with code snippets (GitHub Gists) so those viewing the webinar could code along live or with the recording. My app was also regularly deployed and live on Heroku throughout the webinar.</p>\n<p>The tutorial was roughly split up into four sections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Setup, first push, importing a CSS framework</li>\n<li>Display Todos, create new Todos</li>\n<li>Add a database</li>\n<li>Delete a todo, tick off a todo</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Scoring and Submission</h4>\n<p>Lastly, I ran through what we were looking for in a successful submission, with particular attention to the format of the submission video.</p>\n<p>I also talked about the scoring criteria and gave my final tips and tricks for succeeding in the hackathon. The webinar ended with Q and A, giving candidates valuable time to clarify anything they didn\'t understand.</p>\n<h4>Result</h4>\n<p>After the webinar, I made available on the Facebook group the list of resources I curated, the Todo app repository, the snippet webpage, and a recording of the entire thing.</p>\n<p>I got great feedback from the applicants and my colleagues, who said it was extremely clear and everything was well explained.</p>\n<h2>Mentoring</h2>\n<p>I was allocated all 6 students who chose to use Node/Heroku to mentor through the process. This consisted of encouraging them via facebook and email, and answering any questions they had about the application process or about the technology. Over the week I supported them as best as I could, and got some positive \'thankyou\' responses, but the real feedback came when it was time for judging.</p>\n<p>Myself, some other developers, and some more technically minded management came together to score the submissions and decide which candidates should be invited on-site for an interview.</p>\n<p>I was unbelievably pleased that my mentees made up <strong>55%</strong> (5 out of 9) of the interview candidates! This is likely due to a combination of factors, but I think their use of the Node/Heroku was key, as it allowed them to quickly create advanced functionality.</p>\n<h2>Continued use of Node.js</h2>\n<p>Learning Node.js was a key milestone in my journey as web developer, and I\'ve gone on to use it in a number of apps at work, also becoming the nominal Node.js consultant for our internal PaaS service.</p>\n<p>Example projects I used it in include: an <a href="https://github.com/mattdean1/nodejs-oidc-client-example">OpenID Connect accelerator</a>, a number of metrics dashboards (in combination with <a href="http://www.chartjs.org/">Chart.js</a>), and <a href="https://github.com/mattdean1/reMINDer">a reminder system for people with Alzheimer\'s</a>.</p>\n<p>I\'m currently learning React and Webpack by using them for a couple of projects in work, and although the outcome may not be as dramatic, I hope to write a post featuring these technologies soon.</p>',id:"/Users/matt/Documents/code/gatsby-blog-starter-kit/src/pages/2017-01-17-metamorphosis/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/Users/matt/Documents/code/gatsby-blog-starter-kit/src/pages/2017-01-17-metamorphosis/index.md",timeToRead:5,frontmatter:{date:"2017-01-17T20:39:38Z",path:"/metamorphosis",tags:["lilly","nodejs","javascript"],title:"Metamorphosis",summary:"How I went from knowing nothing about Node.js to running a 90 minute webinar in less than a week"}}],react:[{html:"<p>Over the past year, whilst on placement at Lilly, my main focus was setting up on-premise platform-as-a-service (OpenShift). I worked as part of a small team on this, with a few people in the US and a few in the UK.</p>\n<p>One of the tools we created was a metrics dashboard with charts showing usage information about the platform. For MVP we built this as a Django monolith, which was fine to get something out the door, but it was difficult to coordinate across timezones, since half the team was in the UK and half in the US. Our skillsets were also segregated, with the experienced Django developers sitting in the US whereas the UK team members were more comfortable with Node.js.</p>\n<p>I identified that a microservices architecture would be a better fit for this project so each subteam could develop more independently. We also liked the idea of some of the other advantages of a service-oriented architecture, like independent release schedules and the ability to choose the most suitable stack for each part of the application.</p>\n<h2>The app</h2>\n<h3>MVP 1</h3>\n<p>The Django MVP of our app was pretty basic, hitting the OpenShift API and parsing that data on every page load. We passed that parsed data into the HTML templates and rendered some tables and charts. This did satisfy the baseline requirements of showing management and ourselves the customer uptake of OpenShift, but it had some flaws, first and foremost, page load time. As more customers started checking the dashboard, we also put strain on the OpenShift API, particularly in our Proof-of-Concept environment, where resources are limited.</p>\n<h3>MVP 2</h3>\n<p>Since a lot of the data parsing logic was already implemented in Python, we decided to keep a Django-based backend, but convert it to a RESTful API. During this period we learned a lot about the tradeoffs during API development, and why an API-centric approach to software development can be so powerful in enabling internal collaboration.</p>\n<p>See Jeff Bezos' 'API Mandate' at Amazon in the early 2000's  - he mandated that all employees must develop services in order to share information between teams, i.e. the only way to get access to other internal data was through an API. This edict was transformational to the way Amazon employees worked, and the way the company was structured internally, arguably a big factor in enabling Amazon to go from an online bookstore to the enormous e-commerce and cloud computing platform it is today.</p>\n<p>For the frontend I chose to go with React, hosted on a Node server. These were technologies I had a fair bit of previous experience with, and the dashboard was a good fit for the component-oriented architecture of React app, since we had a similar dataset for all 3 of our OpenShift environments, hence often 3 charts displaying the same kind of data.</p>\n<h2>Wrangling Django</h2>\n<p>For MVP2, converting the backend to return JSON wasn't crazily difficult. We already passed some data into our templates, so we could get a basic response going by returning a <code>django.http JsonResponse</code> instead of <code>render</code>ing a template. Of course this didn't give us a true RESTful API, but for a couple of <code>GET</code> endpoints it did the job.</p>\n<p>One issue I ran into was attempting to serialize our Django objects - when passing an object into a template file you can use Django Classes just fine, but as soon as I tried to serialize these into JSON up popped a whole bunch of errors. Fortunately, out of the box Django provides serialization into JSON as long as you use a <code>Model</code> rather than a <code>Class</code>. Converting our classes to models was relatively straightforward and essentially required me to specify some detail about each field like datatype, length, etc..</p>\n<p>Later, as we built out our API interfacing between OpenShift and our frontend, and we needed more endpoints, especially <code>POST</code>/<code>PUT</code>, we moved to use <a href=\"http://www.django-rest-framework.org/\">Django REST Framework</a> (DRF). DRF is actually a really nice tool, and gives you a lot of features 'for free' as you build an API, like making your API browsable, and easy integration with OAuth. Next time I build an API I'd probably check out something like <a href=\"https://swagger.io/\">Swagger</a>, or explore using a statically typed or functional language like Go or Elixir in the backend.</p>\n<h2>Juggling Javascript</h2>\n<p>I built the frontend in React, using the <a href=\"https://react.semantic-ui.com/introduction\">semantic-ui-react</a> framework, and <a href=\"https://github.com/reactjs/react-chartjs\">react-chartjs</a>. These frameworks made it easy to create a responsive site, and I created some nice pure chart components. The one hurdle I had to watch out for was to get the data from our API in the correct React lifecycle method - I ended up using <code>fetch</code> inside <code>componentDidMount</code>. Sadly Internet Explorer is the default browser at work, so to support that I had to import the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/whatwg-fetch\">whatwg-fetch</a> polyfill.</p>\n<h3>Caching</h3>\n<p>One of the main drawbacks of MVP1 was the page load time, since we fetched data from the OpenShift API on every page load. To try and address this, I decided to add some caching to our app, which happened at a few different layers. I tackled the following bullet points one-by-one, benchmarking page load times at each step.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Since I'm most familiar with Node, I wrote a short cron job using <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-cron\">node-cron</a>, which regularly copied the OpenShift API responses verbatim into redis. Of course I had to edit our backend to consume the cache instead of getting data from OpenShift directly, using <a href=\"https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py\">redis-py</a>.</li>\n<li>This sped up page load times a fair bit, but the data parsing step was still happening on every refresh, since only the raw OpenShift API responses were in redis, not the collated data. So, I added to my cron job - I stored <em>our</em> Django API responses in redis too. After editing the backend again to retrieve the <em>parsed data</em> from redis where possible, this meant page load times were considerably decreased.</li>\n<li>The one 'gotcha' here is that if our API returned its values from the redis cache, how would we update the cache with new values? I set the redis expiry time to be a little lower than the cron frequency, which meant that new results would be computed every time the cron job ran.</li>\n<li>Of course, if redis was down, would that bring down our entire API?

After some extensive googling I found this <a href="https://medium.com/pro-react/a-brief-talk-about-immutability-and-react-s-helpers-70919ab8ae7c">super helpful article</a>.</p>\n<h2>It’s a JS problem</h2>\n<p>Objects and arrays are passed by reference in JS. This means that a new copy is not created, and updating the \'new\' object or array actually modifies the original one.</p>\n<p>In this case I couldn\'t use <code>array.concat</code> or similar non-destructive methods, or <code>object.assign</code> as suggested in the article because I am attempting to modify a nested object so JavaScript will always pass by reference.</p>\n<h2>Immutability helper</h2>\n<p>The article I linked earlier references the built-in React Immutability Helpers, however when I visit the suggested <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/update.html">page in the React docs</a>, I find that "<code>update</code> is a legacy add-on. Use <a href="https://github.com/kolodny/immutability-helper">kolodny/immutability-helper instead</a>."</p>\n<p>This is a fantastic little module that allows us to update e.g. a complicated nested state object "without changing how the data is represented". The syntax is similar to mongodb queries, so didn\'t take long to get used to.</p>\n<p>If you\'re running into issues related to the immutability in more than one place in your application, you might want to look into a more full-featured solution like Facebook\'s <a href="https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/">Immutable.js</a>.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>Remembering to import the library, the createGoal function now looks like this:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-js"><code>createGoal <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n  <span class="token keyword">const</span> newGoal <span class="token operator">=</span> sampleGoal<span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n  newGoal<span class="token punctuation">.</span>title <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>state<span class="token punctuation">.</span>newGoalTitle<span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n  newGoal<span class="token punctuation">.</span>category <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>state<span class="token punctuation">.</span>newGoalCategory<span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n  newGoal<span class="token punctuation">.</span>goal <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>state<span class="token punctuation">.</span>newGoalCost<span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n  newGoal<span class="token punctuation">.</span>start_date <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">new</span> <span class="token class-name">Date</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n\n  <span class="token keyword">let</span> goalsArray <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">update</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>state<span class="token punctuation">.</span>goals<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span> $push<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span>newGoal<span class="token punctuation">]</span> <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>\n\n  <span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">setState</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span> goals<span class="token punctuation">:</span> goalsArray <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>The key line is</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-js"><code><span class="token keyword">let</span> goalsArray <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">update</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>state<span class="token punctuation">.</span>goals<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span> $push<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span>newGoal<span class="token punctuation">]</span> <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>instead of</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-js"><code><span class="token keyword">let</span> goalsArray <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>state<span class="token punctuation">.</span>goals<span class="token punctuation">;</span>\ngoalsArray<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">push</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>newGoal<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>This ensures JavaScript makes a deep copy of the necessary nested elements, instead of passing the object by reference.</p>\n<p>Many thanks to the creator of this library and to my team for having patience while we got to the bottom of this one!</p>',

Most would agree that writing is an essential skill to refine, and I think the best way to for me to do that is to cover topics which I'm passionate about.</p>\n<p>The process of writing things down requires clear thinking, so covering familiar topics will enforce a certain rigor, and perhaps expose some faulty assumptions. Writing a blog post on an unfamiliar topic will be a ideal way to explore, then codify and share my learning.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>To have a public platform where I can share thoughts, experiences, and learning</strong></p>\n<p>I love the idea that you could read my blog and find something useful, whether it be a tutorial for some new technology or a new technique for learning.</p>\n<p>I hope that my experiences will reflect yours, and my thinking will resonate with you. If you learn a fraction of what I do through writing the posts I'll judge it a great success!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>To display and keep a record of all the exciting things I learn about tech</strong></p>\n<p>One of the things I love about technology is that there is always more to learn. There are endless opportunities to read, practice, and use new concepts every day. It will be a sad day if I ever stop learning, so I strive to explore fresh ideas constantly.</p>\n<p>While this blog may serve as an impartial record of my journey through life and the tech industry, I hope it will also be useful to demonstrate my passion for technology.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What can you expect from this blog?</h2>\n<p>At this stage, the exact contents of future posts is still undecided. Everything I write will keep the above principles in mind, so you can expect the majority of posts will be somewhat technology-related. If there's a specific topic you'd like me to cover, please feel free to reach out with suggestions and feedback!</p>\n<p>I hope the form and tone of my writing will develop into a warmer, more conversational style over the coming months - perhaps it will change drastically as I get a clearer idea of the audience and the writing style I'm most comfortable with.</p>\n<p>I'm planning to post at least once a month; this seems like a reasonable cadence to ensure I continue to meet the aims above.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>\n<h2>Technical setup - Blog 0.1 - OUTDATED</h2>\n<h3>Static site generation</h3>\n<p>Currently I'm using <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/\">Hugo</a> to generate a static website. Hugo is a fantastic cross-platform static site generator tool built in Go. I recently dipped my toe into Django too, and I really enjoyed how my knowledge of <a href=\"http://handlebarsjs.com/\">Handlebars</a> templating  crosses over to both python and Go.</p>\n<p>I found it incredibly easy to get up and running with a local server, and love how simply running <code>hugo server</code> sets up automatic server restarts when a file changes, and live reload  in the browser every time that happens.</p>\n<p>I also considered GitHub's offering in this space, <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a>, and to be honest, there wasn't much in it. Hugo's slighly more beginner-friendly docs swung it for me. I'll definitely consider migrating in the future, especially since Jekyll is so closely integrated with GitHub pages. The technical implementation of the blog will evolve along with the writing!</p>\n<p>Once I've learned more about Hugo I'll probably write a more in-depth post - I'm also hoping to contribute to the project on GitHub in the near future.</p>\n<h3>Design &#x26; Writing</h3>\n<p>The look and feel of the blog is currently based on the <a href=\"https://github.com/tmaiaroto/hugo-redlounge\">hugo-redlounge</a> theme - I made a few simplifications and style modifications (for example adding a picture next to each post), but the structure is largely unedited. Using a theme has been an ideal way to get up and running quickly - I prioritised content creation over having a perfectly styled site. The design will be an iterative process, making small modifications and additions as I go along - look out for updates!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://typora.io/\">Typora</a> is an amazing, minimal Markdown editor for writing posts in the flow, without distractions. The best part is it renders style <strong>as you write</strong>, meaning there is only a single window! All the markdown editors I've used previously have two - one for text entry and one for previewing your document.</p>\n<h3>Build process &#x26; Hosting</h3>\n<p>I chose to use <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">GitHub Pages</a> to host this blog initially, mainly due to fact that it's free, but also because Git is a tool I'm very familiar with, Pages integrates seamlessly into my workflow.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.christophvoigt.com/setting-up-hugo-with-github-pages/\">This blog post</a> was invaluable in setting up a quick and easy CI process - I simply <code>git push</code> to the 'source' branch of my GitHub pages repository, and thanks to the magic of <a href=\"https://travis-ci.org/\">Travis CI</a>, my changes are live within ~30 seconds.</p>\n<p>Overall, hosting and CI was one of the sections that's taken the least work so far, since I was pretty happy with the setup 'out of the box'.</p>",id:"/Users/matt/Documents/code/gatsby-blog-starter-kit/src/pages/2016-10-28-promulgation/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/Users/matt/Documents/code/gatsby-blog-starter-kit/src/pages/2016-10-28-promulgation/index.md",timeToRead:4,frontmatter:{date:"2016-10-28T23:17:39Z",path:"/promulgation",tags:["react","gatsby","static site","meta"],title:"Promulgation",summary:"Why I decided to create a blog and how I set it up"}}],python:[{html:"<p>Over the past year, whilst on placement at Lilly, my main focus was setting up on-premise platform-as-a-service (OpenShift). I worked as part of a small team on this, with a few people in the US and a few in the UK.</p>\n<p>One of the tools we created was a metrics dashboard with charts showing usage information about the platform. For MVP we built this as a Django monolith, which was fine to get something out the door, but it was difficult to coordinate across timezones, since half the team was in the UK and half in the US. Our skillsets were also segregated, with the experienced Django developers sitting in the US whereas the UK team members were more comfortable with Node.js.</p>\n<p>I identified that a microservices architecture would be a better fit for this project so each subteam could develop more independently. We also liked the idea of some of the other advantages of a service-oriented architecture, like independent release schedules and the ability to choose the most suitable stack for each part of the application.</p>\n<h2>The app</h2>\n<h3>MVP 1</h3>\n<p>The Django MVP of our app was pretty basic, hitting the OpenShift API and parsing that data on every page load. We passed that parsed data into the HTML templates and rendered some tables and charts. This did satisfy the baseline requirements of showing management and ourselves the customer uptake of OpenShift, but it had some flaws, first and foremost, page load time. As more customers started checking the dashboard, we also put strain on the OpenShift API, particularly in our Proof-of-Concept environment, where resources are limited.</p>\n<h3>MVP 2</h3>\n<p>Since a lot of the data parsing logic was already implemented in Python, we decided to keep a Django-based backend, but convert it to a RESTful API. During this period we learned a lot about the tradeoffs during API development, and why an API-centric approach to software development can be so powerful in enabling internal collaboration.</p>\n<p>See Jeff Bezos' 'API Mandate' at Amazon in the early 2000's  - he mandated that all employees must develop services in order to share information between teams, i.e. the only way to get access to other internal data was through an API. This edict was transformational to the way Amazon employees worked, and the way the company was structured internally, arguably a big factor in enabling Amazon to go from an online bookstore to the enormous e-commerce and cloud computing platform it is today.</p>\n<p>For the frontend I chose to go with React, hosted on a Node server. These were technologies I had a fair bit of previous experience with, and the dashboard was a good fit for the component-oriented architecture of React app, since we had a similar dataset for all 3 of our OpenShift environments, hence often 3 charts displaying the same kind of data.</p>\n<h2>Wrangling Django</h2>\n<p>For MVP2, converting the backend to return JSON wasn't crazily difficult. We already passed some data into our templates, so we could get a basic response going by returning a <code>django.http JsonResponse</code> instead of <code>render</code>ing a template. Of course this didn't give us a true RESTful API, but for a couple of <code>GET</code> endpoints it did the job.</p>\n<p>One issue I ran into was attempting to serialize our Django objects - when passing an object into a template file you can use Django Classes just fine, but as soon as I tried to serialize these into JSON up popped a whole bunch of errors. Fortunately, out of the box Django provides serialization into JSON as long as you use a <code>Model</code> rather than a <code>Class</code>. Converting our classes to models was relatively straightforward and essentially required me to specify some detail about each field like datatype, length, etc..</p>\n<p>Later, as we built out our API interfacing between OpenShift and our frontend, and we needed more endpoints, especially <code>POST</code>/<code>PUT</code>, we moved to use <a href=\"http://www.django-rest-framework.org/\">Django REST Framework</a> (DRF). DRF is actually a really nice tool, and gives you a lot of features 'for free' as you build an API, like making your API browsable, and easy integration with OAuth. Next time I build an API I'd probably check out something like <a href=\"https://swagger.io/\">Swagger</a>, or explore using a statically typed or functional language like Go or Elixir in the backend.</p>\n<h2>Juggling Javascript</h2>\n<p>I built the frontend in React, using the <a href=\"https://react.semantic-ui.com/introduction\">semantic-ui-react</a> framework, and <a href=\"https://github.com/reactjs/react-chartjs\">react-chartjs</a>. These frameworks made it easy to create a responsive site, and I created some nice pure chart components. The one hurdle I had to watch out for was to get the data from our API in the correct React lifecycle method - I ended up using <code>fetch</code> inside <code>componentDidMount</code>. Sadly Internet Explorer is the default browser at work, so to support that I had to import the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/whatwg-fetch\">whatwg-fetch</a> polyfill.</p>\n<h3>Caching</h3>\n<p>One of the main drawbacks of MVP1 was the page load time, since we fetched data from the OpenShift API on every page load. To try and address this, I decided to add some caching to our app, which happened at a few different layers. I tackled the following bullet points one-by-one, benchmarking page load times at each step.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Since I'm most familiar with Node, I wrote a short cron job using <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-cron\">node-cron</a>, which regularly copied the OpenShift API responses verbatim into redis. Of course I had to edit our backend to consume the cache instead of getting data from OpenShift directly, using <a href=\"https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py\">redis-py</a>.</li>\n<li>This sped up page load times a fair bit, but the data parsing step was still happening on every refresh, since only the raw OpenShift API responses were in redis, not the collated data. So, I added to my cron job - I stored <em>our</em> Django API responses in redis too. After editing the backend again to retrieve the <em>parsed data</em> from redis where possible, this meant page load times were considerably decreased.</li>\n<li>The one 'gotcha' here is that if our API returned its values from the redis cache, how would we update the cache with new values? I set the redis expiry time to be a little lower than the cron frequency, which meant that new results would be computed every time the cron job ran.</li>\n<li>Of course, if redis was down, would that bring down our entire API? No, because if a key did not exist (it had expired or redis was down), I would fall back to parsing the data and/or getting data directly from OpenShift.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Further Improvements and takeaways</h2>\n<p>As mentioned previously, we later moved our Django API over to Django Rest Framework, which gave us a lot more reliability and the ability to plug in a Postgres database, which meant we could store historical data too.</p>\n<p>The best part about this migration to DRF was that we didn't have to change the frontend - perhaps we changed what endpoint we hit via an environment variable, but we could pretty much leave the frontend alone since it was a separate service.</p>\n<p>Overall this was a fantastic project which really hammered home the value of service oriented architecture and made me realise that designing an API is harder than it looks!

I worked as part of a small team on this, with a few people in the US and a few in the UK.</p>\n<p>One of the tools we created was a metrics dashboard with charts showing usage information about the platform. For MVP we built this as a Django monolith, which was fine to get something out the door, but it was difficult to coordinate across timezones, since half the team was in the UK and half in the US. Our skillsets were also segregated, with the experienced Django developers sitting in the US whereas the UK team members were more comfortable with Node.js.</p>\n<p>I identified that a microservices architecture would be a better fit for this project so each subteam could develop more independently. We also liked the idea of some of the other advantages of a service-oriented architecture, like independent release schedules and the ability to choose the most suitable stack for each part of the application.</p>\n<h2>The app</h2>\n<h3>MVP 1</h3>\n<p>The Django MVP of our app was pretty basic, hitting the OpenShift API and parsing that data on every page load. We passed that parsed data into the HTML templates and rendered some tables and charts. This did satisfy the baseline requirements of showing management and ourselves the customer uptake of OpenShift, but it had some flaws, first and foremost, page load time. As more customers started checking the dashboard, we also put strain on the OpenShift API, particularly in our Proof-of-Concept environment, where resources are limited.</p>\n<h3>MVP 2</h3>\n<p>Since a lot of the data parsing logic was already implemented in Python, we decided to keep a Django-based backend, but convert it to a RESTful API. During this period we learned a lot about the tradeoffs during API development, and why an API-centric approach to software development can be so powerful in enabling internal collaboration.</p>\n<p>See Jeff Bezos' 'API Mandate' at Amazon in the early 2000's  - he mandated that all employees must develop services in order to share information between teams, i.e. the only way to get access to other internal data was through an API. This edict was transformational to the way Amazon employees worked, and the way the company was structured internally, arguably a big factor in enabling Amazon to go from an online bookstore to the enormous e-commerce and cloud computing platform it is today.</p>\n<p>For the frontend I chose to go with React, hosted on a Node server. These were technologies I had a fair bit of previous experience with, and the dashboard was a good fit for the component-oriented architecture of React app, since we had a similar dataset for all 3 of our OpenShift environments, hence often 3 charts displaying the same kind of data.</p>\n<h2>Wrangling Django</h2>\n<p>For MVP2, converting the backend to return JSON wasn't crazily difficult. We already passed some data into our templates, so we could get a basic response going by returning a <code>django.http JsonResponse</code> instead of <code>render</code>ing a template. Of course this didn't give us a true RESTful API, but for a couple of <code>GET</code> endpoints it did the job.</p>\n<p>One issue I ran into was attempting to serialize our Django objects - when passing an object into a template file you can use Django Classes just fine, but as soon as I tried to serialize these into JSON up popped a whole bunch of errors. Fortunately, out of the box Django provides serialization into JSON as long as you use a <code>Model</code> rather than a <code>Class</code>. Converting our classes to models was relatively straightforward and essentially required me to specify some detail about each field like datatype, length, etc..</p>\n<p>Later, as we built out our API interfacing between OpenShift and our frontend, and we needed more endpoints, especially <code>POST</code>/<code>PUT</code>, we moved to use <a href=\"http://www.django-rest-framework.org/\">Django REST Framework</a> (DRF). DRF is actually a really nice tool, and gives you a lot of features 'for free' as you build an API, like making your API browsable, and easy integration with OAuth. Next time I build an API I'd probably check out something like <a href=\"https://swagger.io/\">Swagger</a>, or explore using a statically typed or functional language like Go or Elixir in the backend.</p>\n<h2>Juggling Javascript</h2>\n<p>I built the frontend in React, using the <a href=\"https://react.semantic-ui.com/introduction\">semantic-ui-react</a> framework, and <a href=\"https://github.com/reactjs/react-chartjs\">react-chartjs</a>. These frameworks made it easy to create a responsive site, and I created some nice pure chart components. The one hurdle I had to watch out for was to get the data from our API in the correct React lifecycle method - I ended up using <code>fetch</code> inside <code>componentDidMount</code>. Sadly Internet Explorer is the default browser at work, so to support that I had to import the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/whatwg-fetch\">whatwg-fetch</a> polyfill.</p>\n<h3>Caching</h3>\n<p>One of the main drawbacks of MVP1 was the page load time, since we fetched data from the OpenShift API on every page load.

Microsoft describes it better than I can:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imagine Cup is a global competition that empowers the next generation of computer science students to team up and use their creativity, passion and knowledge of technology to create applications that shape how we live, work and play. Every year tens of thousands of students from across the globe compete for cash, travel and prizes and for the honor of taking home the Imagine Cup!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My flatmate, Wilson, found out about the competition - after he told me and one of his friends from Uni, Sam, we decided to give it a go. Little did we know we'd make it all the way to the national finals!</p>\n<h2>Our Product</h2>\n<p>After an extensive brainstorming session resulting in many crumpled pieces of paper, we drew inspiration from the then-recently released Wetherspoons app. Their app allows you to order and pay for food and drink from your table - no more waiting at the bar!</p>\n<p>We loved the convenience and thought it'd be great to have this ability at every restaurant or bar. Some market research showed that while some large chains (McDonald's, Wagamamas) recently released apps with similar functionality, no solution existed for independent businesses, or even small to medium size chains.</p>\n<p>So, we chose to create a customer purchase and ordering platform for independent restaurants and bars:</p>\n<p>Onboarding businesses had to be as streamlined as possible, so we created a simple sign-up form, followed by a drag-and-drop web interface for the owner to create their menu. Each menu has a unique QR code for the owner to display e.g. on tables. The owner can log back in at any time to update prices or availability of menu items, which will be instantly reflected in the menu the customer sees.</p>\n<p>The customer scans the QR (or enters the menu ID on our website) and is taken directly to a mobile-optimized webapp where they can see what's on offer and add items to their basket. The customer can then submit their order and pay through PayPal - performing the entire transaction without downloading an app or creating an account!</p>\n<p>Once confirmed, the order goes straight through to a touchscreen (which could be a cheap android tablet) in the kitchen/bar for staff to fulfill. Staff can tap the screen to check orders off once they're completed and keep track of the status.</p>\n<h3>Advantages</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The customer receives their order without leaving their seat!</li>\n<li>Restaurant can reduce front of house staff</li>\n<li>Bar can reduce average wait time</li>\n<li>Front of house staff can focus on what really matters - providing an exceptional customer experience</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Tech</h2>\n<p>The frontend of the app was written in Node.js and Express. We used these technologies since we all had experience with them - for this project we decided we should focus on delivering a great product, and there was still plenty to learn since we were new to the Azure platform.</p>\n<p>We got Azure credit as part of the competition, so it made sense to use Microsoft's platform to host our Node app - we also used an MSSQL database and Azure Redis for caching. I quite enjoyed using Azure - it's becoming difficult to see the differentiation between GCP, AWS, and Azure for basic hosting like this. I think to choose between platforms I'd probably consider pricing first, and for simplicity go with the platform on which I was already using less common functionality like AWS Lambda.</p>\n<h2>The UK finals</h2>\n<p>We submitted a short video pitch and our business plan. After a couple of weeks we got a very exciting email: we were through to the UK finals! The final took place at Microsoft's London offices, where we were given the opportunity to present to such dignitaries as the CTO of Microsoft Accelerator, their Principal Tech Evangelist, and the Director of Azure for Research.</p>\n<p>It was an amazing day, with sessions on entrepreneurship and tons of advice on how to start and scale a business. We got great feedback on our product - the judges highlighted our customer focus and real potential to disrupt the hospitality industry. Unfortunately we didn't make it through to the next stage of the competition, but I had a great time working with Wilson and Sam, and we all learned a lot technically, as well as about creating a startup.</p>\n<p>Some feedback from the judges:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Could definitely see this taking off\"</li>\n<li>\"Slick presentation\"</li>\n<li>\"You've clearly identified and addressed a real problem in this market\"</li>\n<li>\"Solid validation from external stakeholders\"</li>\n</ul>",

After some extensive googling I found this <a href="https://medium.com/pro-react/a-brief-talk-about-immutability-and-react-s-helpers-70919ab8ae7c">super helpful article</a>.</p>\n<h2>It’s a JS problem</h2>\n<p>Objects and arrays are passed by reference in JS. This means that a new copy is not created, and updating the \'new\' object or array actually modifies the original one.</p>\n<p>In this case I couldn\'t use <code>array.concat</code> or similar non-destructive methods, or <code>object.assign</code> as suggested in the article because I am attempting to modify a nested object so JavaScript will always pass by reference.</p>\n<h2>Immutability helper</h2>\n<p>The article I linked earlier references the built-in React Immutability Helpers, however when I visit the suggested <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/update.html">page in the React docs</a>, I find that "<code>update</code> is a legacy add-on. Use <a href="https://github.com/kolodny/immutability-helper">kolodny/immutability-helper instead</a>."</p>\n<p>This is a fantastic little module that allows us to update e.g. a complicated nested state object "without changing how the data is represented". The syntax is similar to mongodb queries, so didn\'t take long to get used to.</p>\n<p>If you\'re running into issues related to the immutability in more than one place in your application, you might want to look into a more full-featured solution like Facebook\'s <a href="https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/">Immutable.js</a>.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>Remembering to import the library,

interesting bug I ran into during the Starling Bank hackathon"}}],nodejs:[{html:'<p>This post details how I went from knowing zero Node.js to running a 90 minute webinar on it in less than a week! To summarise, I introduced a new recruitment hackathon stream using Node.js, which increased the number of applications by <strong>25%</strong>. The students using the new platform (all of whom I also mentored), made up <strong>55%</strong> of the candidates invited to interview.</p>\n<p>The junior developer recruitment process at Eli Lilly consists of a week-long online hackathon, followed by on-site interviews. During the time I applied, the development language used for the hack was restricted to Salesforce.com.</p>\n<p>The conversion rate of applicants was fairly low for my intake, with a number of applicants failing to submit at the end of the hackathon. After consideration, and talking to some colleagues who went through this process, I spotted an opportunity to improve the number of applicants and their conversion rate.</p>\n<p>The key issue was the lack of flexibility - Salesforce is a useful platform, and experience with Java can transfer well, but for those with prior experience in web development the limitations could be frustrating. Any new platform added also needed to have a free trial, and be accessible to those with little/no experience.</p>\n<h2>Choosing the platform</h2>\n<p>Node.js on Heroku seemed like a good choice of language and platform due to its plethora of packages (allowing applicants to add complex functionality quickly), wide usage within Lilly (giving us expertise to lean on for judging), and easy integration with other free tools like GitHub.</p>\n<p>A number of tasks had to be completed before offering this application stream to the next set of applicants:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An example application submission to demonstrate the quality of work expected</li>\n<li>Detailed mark scheme / scoring criteria</li>\n<li>Training video(s) to get those with little previous experience up to speed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I therefore decided to simulate the hackathon process end to end using our new framework. This way I could test it out and see if it would be possible for someone who didn\'t know Node to produce something comparable to those choosing the Salesforce path.</p>\n<p>One of our graduate developers who had previous experience with Node created the scoring criteria, and off I went!</p>\n<h2>Learning Node and ideation</h2>\n<p>Step one was to learn Node.js. I collected plenty of resources - software, articles, and tutorials, then began to work through them. One particularly useful tool was <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html">express-generator</a>, which creates a barebones Node.js/Express app filestructure.</p>\n<p>I then had to think of an idea. As part of the hackathon, we provide applicants with some \'challenges\' to help with the ideation phase. These take the form of quite general problems related to healthcare, for example encouraging diabetics to exercise, or distributing food around the world.</p>\n<p>The idea I settled on was to help distribute supplies to those affected by a natural disaster. <a href="https://github.com/mattdean1/quake-supply">Quake-supply</a> intends to track supplies distributed through field outposts after an earthquake.</p>\n<h2>Example submission</h2>\n<p>I created my sample app over a couple of days, learning more about Node along the way.</p>\n<p>I pull live data from the US Geological Survey API to get the coordinates and magnitude of the most recent earthquakes, and use <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet.js</a> for mapping. I also used <a href="http://t4t5.github.io/sweetalert/">SweetAlert</a> and <a href="https://datatables.net/">DataTables</a> to help make it look presentable.</p>\n<p>Once the app was finished, I recorded a <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwAduYXoO8I">video</a></strong> explaining the idea, the app, and how I created it.</p>\n<h2>Webinar</h2>\n<p>I ran a live webinar to give the students more information about the hackathon, show them how to get started on the platform, and give them a chance to ask questions. There was a separate webinar run for the Salesforce stream so for this one I was on my own - after a brief introduction by the sponsor of the program, it was down to me. Here\'s the structure of the content I presented:</p>\n<h4>Tools</h4>\n<p>First, I thought it\'d be a good idea to introduce the students to some of the key tooling and the platform. For this webinar I had to assume they had no previous web development experience, so it was difficult to strike a balance between being high-level and detailed.</p>\n<p>I gave a quick rundown of GitHub, PaaS, Heroku, Atom, and express-generator.</p>\n<h4>CRUD through a todo app</h4>\n<p>Secondly, I introduced the Connect, Request, Update, and Delete operations on a Node/Mongo stack by creating a basic todo app. I generated the file structure using express-generator and explained each folder, then got straight into coding.</p>\n<p>I used a pre-prepared webpage with code snippets (GitHub Gists) so those viewing the webinar could code along live or with the recording. My app was also regularly deployed and live on Heroku throughout the webinar.</p>\n<p>The tutorial was roughly split up into four sections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Setup, first push, importing a CSS framework</li>\n<li>Display Todos, create new Todos</li>\n<li>Add a database</li>\n<li>Delete a todo, tick off a todo</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Scoring and Submission</h4>\n<p>Lastly, I ran through what we were looking for in a successful submission, with particular attention to the format of the submission video.</p>\n<p>I also talked about the scoring criteria and gave my final tips and tricks for succeeding in the hackathon. The webinar ended with Q and A, giving candidates valuable time to clarify anything they didn\'t understand.</p>\n<h4>Result</h4>\n<p>After the webinar, I made available on the Facebook group the list of resources I curated, the Todo app repository, the snippet webpage, and a recording of the entire thing.</p>\n<p>I got great feedback from the applicants and my colleagues, who said it was extremely clear and everything was well explained.</p>\n<h2>Mentoring</h2>\n<p>I was allocated all 6 students who chose to use Node/Heroku to mentor through the process. This consisted of encouraging them via facebook and email, and answering any questions they had about the application process or about the technology. Over the week I supported them as best as I could, and got some positive \'thankyou\' responses, but the real feedback came when it was time for judging.</p>\n<p>Myself, some other developers, and some more technically minded management came together to score the submissions and decide which candidates should be invited on-site for an interview.</p>\n<p>I was unbelievably pleased that my mentees made up <strong>55%</strong> (5 out of 9) of the interview candidates! This is likely due to a combination of factors, but I think their use of the Node/Heroku was key, as it allowed them to quickly create advanced functionality.</p>\n<h2>Continued use of Node.js</h2>\n<p>Learning Node.js was a key milestone in my journey as web developer, and I\'ve gone on to use it in a number of apps at work, also becoming the nominal Node.js consultant for our internal PaaS service.</p>\n<p>Example projects I used it in include: an <a href="https://github.com/mattdean1/nodejs-oidc-client-example">OpenID Connect accelerator</a>, a number of metrics dashboards (in combination with <a href="http://www.chartjs.org/">Chart.js</a>), and <a href="https://github.com/mattdean1/reMINDer">a reminder system for people with Alzheimer\'s</a>.</p>\n<p>I\'m currently learning React and Webpack by using them for a couple of projects in work, and although the outcome may not be as dramatic, I hope to write a post featuring these technologies soon.</p>',id:"/Users/matt/Documents/code/gatsby-blog-starter-kit/src/pages/2017-01-17-metamorphosis/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/Users/matt/Documents/code/gatsby-blog-starter-kit/src/pages/2017-01-17-metamorphosis/index.md",timeToRead:5,frontmatter:{date:"2017-01-17T20:39:38Z",path:"/metamorphosis",tags:["lilly","nodejs","javascript"],title:"Metamorphosis",summary:"How I went from knowing nothing about Node.js to running a 90 minute webinar in less than a week"}}],placement:[{html:"<p>I'm currently on a year in industry, working at Eli Lilly and Company in Basingstoke. As part of my degree, I take a year to out to work, giving me invaluable experience, but also giving me time and space to figure out my ideal career path. In this post I'll talk about the first few weeks there and the process of settling in.</p>\n<p>This is my first entry into the corporate world, previous jobs having been at much smaller companies.</p>\n<p>There was so much take in at the beginning: business skills, information about the company, names and faces - never mind the technology! I feel like a lot of this was tacit knowledge, particularly the unwritten rules and expectations that came with being a new intern.</p>\n<h3>Initial Pressure</h3>\n<p>It didn't help that the student I was replacing, Tom, was one of the best in his cohort. He did an amazing job helping me to find my feet, but hearing him recount his accomplishments often made me think 'how could I ever come close?'.</p>\n<p>A new graduate, Alex, started in our team at the same time as I did. Our skillsets were (are?) quite different, so I don't think we felt too much competition, but there was an unavoidable element of comparison. In hindsight, this was a good thing, because it made me hold myself to a higher standard, but in the early days it added another facet to the pressure!</p>\n<p>One of the scariest things Tom and Alex 'suggested' I do was run a 'lunch and learn' - present a topic of my choice at a lunchtime. The audience was mainly the new students, which was a relief in the way that no higher-ups were there, but of course I didn't want to look like an idiot in from of my peers!</p>\n<p>Looking back, this was probably the single most valuable thing for increasing my confidence, and gaining exposure - thanks guys.</p>\n<h3>Information overload</h3>\n<p>Along with the 'big shoes to fill', there was an vast amount of incoming information. From company mission through departmental responsibilities all the way to individual roles, it was definitely a case of 'death by powerpoint'.</p>\n<p>A big issue was the number of abbreviations and jargon thrown around. Most people probably don't realise they do it, and it certainly speeds up information transfer once everyone knows them, but it increased the initial learning curve dramatically.</p>\n<p>It may not be immediately obvious, but learning so many names and faces at once was also a challenge. With all the other info being fired at me, I sometimes had to ask for introductions more than once.</p>\n<h3>Tech learning curve</h3>\n<p>Fortunately, the tech learning curve wasn't as steep initially - at least in the first week or two. I started off with a fairly simple project - developing an anonymous online forum for employees to raise questions with senior management. I chose to use PHP, since that was the web language I was most familiar with. However, I soon ran into some hurdles - developing behind the corporate proxy was one, working on a windows machine another. It took a while to get my environment set up similar enough to the Macbook I'd been using for the past 5+ years, but thanks to <a href=\"http://cmder.net/\">Cmder</a>, <a href=\"https://atom.io/\">Atom</a> and the <code>http_proxy</code> environment variable I eventually got into the groove.</p>\n<p>I was also blazing a trail with some of my work on OpenShift. A decent part of my role focuses on setting up this internal PaaS as a production service, so I was deploying apps, writing scripts, and integrating with databases - things that our customers wanted but no-one had attempted before. This was amazing fun, but did lead to some days of frustration when the environment was unstable.</p>\n<p>While a large part of my dayjob remained working on OpenShift, I quickly moved on to learn new web technologies and new platforms - check my post where I tell the story of [how I learned Node.js and ran a 90-minute webinar in one week]!</p>\n<h3>Now</h3>\n<p>I'd say it took me 3-4 months to feel fully comfortable in my role, and ramp up to full speed. That isn't to stay I stopped learning - every day brings a fresh challenge.</p>\n<p>Comparing myself now to myself at the start of the year, I'm amazed. My confidence has been vastly increased, my technical abilities have come on in leaps and bounds, and my business skills are also much better. It's been a great year so far, and I think I've built a fantastic foundation to continue learning and growing. Here's to the rest of the year and the future!</p>",id:"/Users/matt/Documents/code/gatsby-blog-starter-kit/src/pages/2016-12-05-assimiliation/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/Users/matt/Documents/code/gatsby-blog-starter-kit/src/pages/2016-12-05-assimiliation/index.md",timeToRead:3,frontmatter:{date:"2016-12-05T13:35:13.234Z",path:"/assimilation",tags:["placement","lilly"],title:"Assimilation",summary:"Entering a Fortune 500 company and the corporate world"}}],gatsby:[{html:"<h2>Why blog?</h2>\n<p>I decided to create this blog for three reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>To practice writing and clarify my thinking</strong></p>\n<p>I've produced very few extended pieces of writing over the past 5 years, in part due to my subject choices at A-Level and Uni.

I recently dipped my toe into Django too, and I really enjoyed how my knowledge of <a href=\"http://handlebarsjs.com/\">Handlebars</a> templating  crosses over to both python and Go.</p>\n<p>I found it incredibly easy to get up and running with a local server, and love how simply running <code>hugo server</code> sets up automatic server restarts when a file changes, and live reload  in the browser every time that happens.</p>\n<p>I also considered GitHub's offering in this space, <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a>, and to be honest, there wasn't much in it. Hugo's slighly more beginner-friendly docs swung it for me. I'll definitely consider migrating in the future, especially since Jekyll is so closely integrated with GitHub pages. The technical implementation of the blog will evolve along with the writing!</p>\n<p>Once I've learned more about Hugo I'll probably write a more in-depth post - I'm also hoping to contribute to the project on GitHub in the near future.</p>\n<h3>Design &#x26; Writing</h3>\n<p>The look and feel of the blog is currently based on the <a href=\"https://github.com/tmaiaroto/hugo-redlounge\">hugo-redlounge</a> theme - I made a few simplifications and style modifications (for example adding a picture next to each post), but the structure is largely unedited. Using a theme has been an ideal way to get up and running quickly - I prioritised content creation over having a perfectly styled site. The design will be an iterative process, making small modifications and additions as I go along - look out for updates!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://typora.io/\">Typora</a> is an amazing, minimal Markdown editor for writing posts in the flow, without distractions. The best part is it renders style <strong>as you write</strong>, meaning there is only a single window! All the markdown editors I've used previously have two - one for text entry and one for previewing your document.</p>\n<h3>Build process &#x26; Hosting</h3>\n<p>I chose to use <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">GitHub Pages</a> to host this blog initially, mainly due to fact that it's free, but also because Git is a tool I'm very familiar with, Pages integrates seamlessly into my workflow.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.christophvoigt.com/setting-up-hugo-with-github-pages/\">This blog post</a> was invaluable in setting up a quick and easy CI process - I simply <code>git push</code> to the 'source' branch of my GitHub pages repository, and thanks to the magic of <a href=\"https://travis-ci.org/\">Travis CI</a>, my changes are live within ~30 seconds.</p>\n<p>Overall, hosting and CI was one of the sections that's taken the least work so far, since I was pretty happy with the setup 'out of the box'.</p>",id:"/Users/matt/Documents/code/gatsby-blog-starter-kit/src/pages/2016-10-28-promulgation/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/Users/matt/Documents/code/gatsby-blog-starter-kit/src/pages/2016-10-28-promulgation/index.md",timeToRead:4,frontmatter:{date:"2016-10-28T23:17:39Z",path:"/promulgation",tags:["react","gatsby","static site","meta"],title:"Promulgation",summary:"Why I decided to create a blog and how I set it up"}}],tag:"meta"}}}});
