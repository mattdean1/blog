To summarise, I introduced a new recruitment hackathon stream using Node.js, which increased the number of applications by <strong>25%</strong>. The students using the new platform (all of whom I also mentored), made up <strong>55%</strong> of the candidates invited to interview.</p>\\n<p>The junior developer recruitment process at Eli Lilly consists of a week-long online hackathon, followed by on-site interviews. During the time I applied, the development language used for the hack was restricted to Salesforce.com.</p>\\n<p>The conversion rate of applicants was fairly low for my intake, with a number of applicants failing to submit at the end of the hackathon. After consideration, and talking to some colleagues who went through this process, I spotted an opportunity to improve the number of applicants and their conversion rate.</p>\\n<p>The key issue was the lack of flexibility - Salesforce is a useful platform, and experience with Java can transfer well, but for those with prior experience in web development the limitations could be frustrating. Any new platform added also needed to have a free trial, and be accessible to those with little/no experience.</p>\\n<h2>Choosing the platform</h2>\\n<p>Node.js on Heroku seemed like a good choice of language and platform due to its plethora of packages (allowing applicants to add complex functionality quickly), wide usage within Lilly (giving us expertise to lean on for judging), and easy integration with other free tools like GitHub.</p>\\n<p>A number of tasks had to be completed before offering this application stream to the next set of applicants:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>An example application submission to demonstrate the quality of work expected</li>\\n<li>Detailed mark scheme / scoring criteria</li>\\n<li>Training video(s) to get those with little previous experience up to speed</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>I therefore decided to simulate the hackathon process end to end using our new framework. This way I could test it out and see if it would be possible for someone who didn't know Node to produce something comparable to those choosing the Salesforce path.</p>\\n<p>One of our graduate developers who had previous experience with Node created the scoring criteria, and off I went!</p>\\n<h2>Learning Node and ideation</h2>\\n<p>Step one was to learn Node.js. I collected plenty of resources - software, articles, and tutorials, then began to work through them. One particularly useful tool was <a href=\\\"https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html\\\">express-generator</a>, which creates a barebones Node.js/Express app filestructure.</p>\\n<p>I then had to think of an idea. As part of the hackathon, we provide applicants with some 'challenges' to help with the ideation phase. These take the form of quite general problems related to healthcare, for example encouraging diabetics to exercise, or distributing food around the world.</p>\\n<p>The idea I settled on was to help distribute supplies to those affected by a natural disaster. <a href=\\\"https://github.com/mattdean1/quake-supply\\\">Quake-supply</a> intends to track supplies distributed through field outposts after an earthquake.</p>\\n<h2>Example submission</h2>\\n<p>I created my sample app over a couple of days, learning more about Node along the way.</p>\\n<p>I pull live data from the US Geological Survey API to get the coordinates and magnitude of the most recent earthquakes, and use <a href=\\\"http://leafletjs.com/\\\">Leaflet.js</a> for mapping. I also used <a href=\\\"http://t4t5.github.io/sweetalert/\\\">SweetAlert</a> and <a href=\\\"https://datatables.net/\\\">DataTables</a> to help make it look presentable.</p>\\n<p>Once the app was finished, I recorded a <strong><a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwAduYXoO8I\\\">video</a></strong> explaining the idea, the app, and how I created it.</p>\\n<h2>Webinar</h2>\\n<p>I ran a live webinar to give the students more information about the hackathon, show them how to get started on the platform, and give them a chance to ask questions. There was a separate webinar run for the Salesforce stream so for this one I was on my own - after a brief introduction by the sponsor of the program, it was down to me. Here's the structure of the content I presented:</p>\\n<h4>Tools</h4>\\n<p>First, I thought it'd be a good idea to introduce the students to some of the key tooling and the platform. For this webinar I had to assume they had no previous web development experience, so it was difficult to strike a balance between being high-level and detailed.</p>\\n<p>I gave a quick rundown of GitHub, PaaS, Heroku, Atom, and express-generator.</p>\\n<h4>CRUD through a todo app</h4>\\n<p>Secondly, I introduced the Connect, Request, Update, and Delete operations on a Node/Mongo stack by creating a basic todo app. I generated the file structure using express-generator and explained each folder, then got straight into coding.</p>\\n<p>I used a pre-prepared webpage with code snippets (GitHub Gists) so those viewing the webinar could code along live or with the recording. My app was also regularly deployed and live on Heroku throughout the webinar.</p>\\n<p>The tutorial was roughly split up into four sections:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Setup, first push, importing a CSS framework</li>\\n<li>Display Todos, create new Todos</li>\\n<li>Add a database</li>\\n<li>Delete a todo, tick off a todo</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>Scoring and Submission</h4>\\n<p>Lastly, I ran through what we were looking for in a successful submission, with particular attention to the format of the submission video.</p>\\n<p>I also talked about the scoring criteria and gave my final tips and tricks for succeeding in the hackathon. The webinar ended with Q and A, giving candidates valuable time to clarify anything they didn't understand.</p>\\n<h4>Result</h4>\\n<p>After the webinar, I made available on the Facebook group the list of resources I curated, the Todo app repository, the snippet webpage, and a recording of the entire thing.</p>\\n<p>I got great feedback from the applicants and my colleagues, who said it was extremely clear and everything was well explained.</p>\\n<h2>Mentoring</h2>\\n<p>I was allocated all 6 students who chose to use Node/Heroku to mentor through the process. This consisted of encouraging them via facebook and email, and answering any questions they had about the application process or about the technology. Over the week I supported them as best as I could, and got some positive 'thankyou' responses, but the real feedback came when it was time for judging.</p>\\n<p>Myself, some other developers, and some more technically minded management came together to score the submissions and decide which candidates should be invited on-site for an interview.</p>\\n<p>I was unbelievably pleased that my mentees made up <strong>55%</strong> (5 out of 9) of the interview candidates! This is likely due to a combination of factors, but I think their use of the Node/Heroku was key, as it allowed them to quickly create advanced functionality.</p>\\n<h2>Continued use of Node.js</h2>\\n<p>Learning Node.js was a key milestone in my journey as web developer, and I've gone on to use it in a number of apps at work, also becoming the nominal Node.js consultant for our internal PaaS service.</p>\\n<p>Example projects I used it in include: an <a href=\\\"https://github.com/mattdean1/nodejs-oidc-client-example\\\">OpenID Connect accelerator</a>, a number of metrics dashboards (in combination with <a href=\\\"http://www.chartjs.org/\\\">Chart.js</a>), and <a href=\\\"https://github.com/mattdean1/reMINDer\\\">a reminder system for people with Alzheimer's</a>.</p>\\n<p>I'm currently learning React and Webpack by using them for a couple of projects in work, and although the outcome may not be as dramatic, I hope to write a post featuring these technologies soon.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/matt/Documents/code/gatsby-blog-starter-kit/src/pages/2017-01-17-metamorphosis/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"fileAbsolutePath\":\"/Users/matt/Documents/code/gatsby-blog-starter-kit/src/pages/2017-01-17-metamorphosis/index.md\",\"timeToRead\":5,\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"2017-01-17T20:39:38Z\",\"path\":\"/metamorphosis\",\"tags\":[\"lilly\",\"nodejs\",\"javascript\"],\"title\":\"Metamorphosis\",\"summary\":\"How I went from knowing nothing about Node.js to running a 90 minute webinar in less than a week\"}},\"next\":{\"html\":\"<h2>Why blog?</h2>\\n<p>I decided to create this blog for three reasons:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>To practice writing and clarify my thinking</strong></p>\\n<p>I've produced very few extended pieces of writing over the past 5 years, in part due to my subject choices at A-Level and Uni. Most would agree that writing is an essential skill to refine, and I think the best way to for me to do that is to cover topics which I'm passionate about.</p>\\n<p>The process of writing things down requires clear thinking, so covering familiar topics will enforce a certain rigor, and perhaps expose some faulty assumptions. Writing a blog post on an unfamiliar topic will be a ideal way to explore, then codify and share my learning.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>To have a public platform where I can share thoughts, experiences, and learning</strong></p>\\n<p>I love the idea that you could read my blog and find something useful, whether it be a tutorial for some new technology or a new technique for learning.</p>\\n<p>I hope that my experiences will reflect yours, and my thinking will resonate with you. If you learn a fraction of what I do through writing the posts I'll judge it a great success!</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>To display and keep a record of all the exciting things I learn about tech</strong></p>\\n<p>One of the things I love about technology is that there is always more to learn. There are endless opportunities to read, practice, and use new concepts every day. It will be a sad day if I ever stop learning, so I strive to explore fresh ideas constantly.</p>\\n<p>While this blog may serve as an impartial record of my journey through life and the tech industry, I hope it will also be useful to demonstrate my passion for technology.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h2>What can you expect from this blog?</h2>\\n<p>At this stage, the exact contents of future posts is still undecided. Everything I write will keep the above principles in mind, so you can expect the majority of posts will be somewhat technology-related. If there's a specific topic you'd like me to cover, please feel free to reach out with suggestions and feedback!</p>\\n<p>I hope the form and tone of my writing will develop into a warmer, more conversational style over the coming months - perhaps it will change drastically as I get a clearer idea of the audience and the writing style I'm most comfortable with.</p>\\n<p>I'm planning to post at least once a month; this seems like a reasonable cadence to ensure I continue to meet the aims above.</p>\\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>\\n<h2>Technical setup - Blog 1.0</h2>\\n<h3>Static site generation</h3>\\n<p>Currently I'm using <a href=\\\"https://gohugo.io/\\\">Hugo</a> to generate a static website. Hugo is a fantastic cross-platform static site generator tool built in Go. I recently dipped my toe into Django too, and I really enjoyed how my knowledge of <a href=\\\"http://handlebarsjs.com/\\\">Handlebars</a> templating  crosses over to both python and Go.</p>\\n<p>I found it incredibly easy to get up and running with a local server, and love how simply running <code>hugo server</code> sets up automatic server restarts when a file changes, and live reload  in the browser every time that happens.</p>\\n<p>I also considered GitHub's offering in this space, <a href=\\\"https://jekyllrb.com/\\\">Jekyll</a>, and to be honest, there wasn't much in it. Hugo's slighly more beginner-friendly docs swung it for me. I'll definitely consider migrating in the future, especially since Jekyll is so closely integrated with GitHub pages. The technical implementation of the blog will evolve along with the writing!</p>\\n<p>Once I've learned more about Hugo I'll probably write a more in-depth post - I'm also hoping to contribute to the project on GitHub in the near future.</p>\\n<h3>Design &#x26; Writing</h3>\\n<p>The look and feel of the blog is currently based on the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/tmaiaroto/hugo-redlounge\\\">hugo-redlounge</a> theme - I made a few simplifications and style modifications (for example adding a picture next to each post), but the structure is largely unedited. Using a theme has been an ideal way to get up and running quickly - I prioritised content creation over having a perfectly styled site. The design will be an iterative process, making small modifications and additions as I go along - look out for updates!</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://typora.io/\\\">Typora</a> is an amazing, minimal Markdown editor for writing posts in the flow, without distractions. The best part is it renders style <strong>as you write</strong>, meaning there is only a single window! All the markdown editors I've used previously have two - one for text entry and one for previewing your document.</p>\\n<h3>Build process &#x26; Hosting</h3>\\n<p>I chose to use <a href=\\\"https://pages.github.com/\\\">GitHub Pages</a> to host this blog initially, mainly due to fact that it's free, but also because Git is a tool I'm very familiar with, Pages integrates seamlessly into my workflow.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://blog.christophvoigt.com/setting-up-hugo-with-github-pages/\\\">This blog post</a> was invaluable in setting up a quick and easy CI process - I simply <code>git push</code> to the 'source' branch of my GitHub pages repository, and thanks to the magic of <a href=\\\"https://travis-ci.org/\\\">Travis CI</a>, my changes are live within ~30 seconds.</p>\\n<p>Overall, hosting and CI was one of the sections that's taken the least work so far, since I was pretty happy with the setup 'out of the box'.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/matt/Documents/code/gatsby-blog-starter-kit/src/pages/2016-10-28-promulgation/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"fileAbsolutePath\":\"/Users/matt/Documents/code/gatsby-blog-starter-kit/src/pages/2016-10-28-promulgation/index.md\",\"timeToRead\":4,\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28T23:17:39Z\",\"path\":\"/promulgation\",\"tags\":[\"react\",\"gatsby\",\"static site\",\"meta\"],\"title\":\"Promulgation\",\"summary\":\"Why I decided to create a blog and how I set it up\"}}}}\n\n/***/ })\n\n});\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// path---assimilation-fe6a62ce04a6121e60d4.js","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"markdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>I'm currently on a year in industry, working at Eli Lilly and Company in Basingstoke.

To summarise, I introduced a new recruitment hackathon stream using Node.js, which increased the number of applications by <strong>25%</strong>. The students using the new platform (all of whom I also mentored), made up <strong>55%</strong> of the candidates invited to interview.</p>\\n<p>The junior developer recruitment process at Eli Lilly consists of a week-long online hackathon, followed by on-site interviews. During the time I applied, the development language used for the hack was restricted to Salesforce.com.</p>\\n<p>The conversion rate of applicants was fairly low for my intake, with a number of applicants failing to submit at the end of the hackathon. After consideration, and talking to some colleagues who went through this process, I spotted an opportunity to improve the number of applicants and their conversion rate.</p>\\n<p>The key issue was the lack of flexibility - Salesforce is a useful platform, and experience with Java can transfer well, but for those with prior experience in web development the limitations could be frustrating. Any new platform added also needed to have a free trial, and be accessible to those with little/no experience.</p>\\n<h2>Choosing the platform</h2>\\n<p>Node.js on Heroku seemed like a good choice of language and platform due to its plethora of packages (allowing applicants to add complex functionality quickly), wide usage within Lilly (giving us expertise to lean on for judging), and easy integration with other free tools like GitHub.</p>\\n<p>A number of tasks had to be completed before offering this application stream to the next set of applicants:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>An example application submission to demonstrate the quality of work expected</li>\\n<li>Detailed mark scheme / scoring criteria</li>\\n<li>Training video(s) to get those with little previous experience up to speed</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>I therefore decided to simulate the hackathon process end to end using our new framework. This way I could test it out and see if it would be possible for someone who didn't know Node to produce something comparable to those choosing the Salesforce path.</p>\\n<p>One of our graduate developers who had previous experience with Node created the scoring criteria, and off I went!</p>\\n<h2>Learning Node and ideation</h2>\\n<p>Step one was to learn Node.js. I collected plenty of resources - software, articles, and tutorials, then began to work through them. One particularly useful tool was <a href=\\\"https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html\\\">express-generator</a>, which creates a barebones Node.js/Express app filestructure.</p>\\n<p>I then had to think of an idea. As part of the hackathon, we provide applicants with some 'challenges' to help with the ideation phase. These take the form of quite general problems related to healthcare, for example encouraging diabetics to exercise, or distributing food around the world.</p>\\n<p>The idea I settled on was to help distribute supplies to those affected by a natural disaster. <a href=\\\"https://github.com/mattdean1/quake-supply\\\">Quake-supply</a> intends to track supplies distributed through field outposts after an earthquake.</p>\\n<h2>Example submission</h2>\\n<p>I created my sample app over a couple of days, learning more about Node along the way.</p>\\n<p>I pull live data from the US Geological Survey API to get the coordinates and magnitude of the most recent earthquakes, and use <a href=\\\"http://leafletjs.com/\\\">Leaflet.js</a> for mapping. I also used <a href=\\\"http://t4t5.github.io/sweetalert/\\\">SweetAlert</a> and <a href=\\\"https://datatables.net/\\\">DataTables</a> to help make it look presentable.</p>\\n<p>Once the app was finished, I recorded a <strong><a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwAduYXoO8I\\\">video</a></strong> explaining the idea, the app, and how I created it.</p>\\n<h2>Webinar</h2>\\n<p>I ran a live webinar to give the students more information about the hackathon, show them how to get started on the platform, and give them a chance to ask questions. There was a separate webinar run for the Salesforce stream so for this one I was on my own - after a brief introduction by the sponsor of the program, it was down to me. Here's the structure of the content I presented:</p>\\n<h4>Tools</h4>\\n<p>First, I thought it'd be a good idea to introduce the students to some of the key tooling and the platform. For this webinar I had to assume they had no previous web development experience, so it was difficult to strike a balance between being high-level and detailed.</p>\\n<p>I gave a quick rundown of GitHub, PaaS, Heroku, Atom, and express-generator.</p>\\n<h4>CRUD through a todo app</h4>\\n<p>Secondly, I introduced the Connect, Request, Update, and Delete operations on a Node/Mongo stack by creating a basic todo app. I generated the file structure using express-generator and explained each folder, then got straight into coding.</p>\\n<p>I used a pre-prepared webpage with code snippets (GitHub Gists) so those viewing the webinar could code along live or with the recording. My app was also regularly deployed and live on Heroku throughout the webinar.</p>\\n<p>The tutorial was roughly split up into four sections:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Setup, first push, importing a CSS framework</li>\\n<li>Display Todos, create new Todos</li>\\n<li>Add a database</li>\\n<li>Delete a todo, tick off a todo</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>Scoring and Submission</h4>\\n<p>Lastly, I ran through what we were looking for in a successful submission, with particular attention to the format of the submission video.</p>\\n<p>I also talked about the scoring criteria and gave my final tips and tricks for succeeding in the hackathon. The webinar ended with Q and A, giving candidates valuable time to clarify anything they didn't understand.</p>\\n<h4>Result</h4>\\n<p>After the webinar, I made available on the Facebook group the list of resources I curated, the Todo app repository, the snippet webpage, and a recording of the entire thing.</p>\\n<p>I got great feedback from the applicants and my colleagues, who said it was extremely clear and everything was well explained.</p>\\n<h2>Mentoring</h2>\\n<p>I was allocated all 6 students who chose to use Node/Heroku to mentor through the process. This consisted of encouraging them via facebook and email, and answering any questions they had about the application process or about the technology. Over the week I supported them as best as I could, and got some positive 'thankyou' responses, but the real feedback came when it was time for judging.</p>\\n<p>Myself, some other developers, and some more technically minded management came together to score the submissions and decide which candidates should be invited on-site for an interview.</p>\\n<p>I was unbelievably pleased that my mentees made up <strong>55%</strong> (5 out of 9) of the interview candidates! This is likely due to a combination of factors, but I think their use of the Node/Heroku was key, as it allowed them to quickly create advanced functionality.</p>\\n<h2>Continued use of Node.js</h2>\\n<p>Learning Node.js was a key milestone in my journey as web developer, and I've gone on to use it in a number of apps at work, also becoming the nominal Node.js consultant for our internal PaaS service.</p>\\n<p>Example projects I used it in include: an <a href=\\\"https://github.com/mattdean1/nodejs-oidc-client-example\\\">OpenID Connect accelerator</a>, a number of metrics dashboards (in combination with <a href=\\\"http://www.chartjs.org/\\\">Chart.js</a>), and <a href=\\\"https://github.com/mattdean1/reMINDer\\\">a reminder system for people with Alzheimer's</a>.</p>\\n<p>I'm currently learning React and Webpack by using them for a couple of projects in work, and although the outcome may not be as dramatic, I hope to write a post featuring these technologies soon.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/matt/Documents/code/gatsby-blog-starter-kit/src/pages/2017-01-17-metamorphosis/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"fileAbsolutePath\":\"/Users/matt/Documents/code/gatsby-blog-starter-kit/src/pages/2017-01-17-metamorphosis/index.md\",\"timeToRead\":5,\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"2017-01-17T20:39:38Z\",\"path\":\"/metamorphosis\",\"tags\":[\"lilly\",\"nodejs\",\"javascript\"],\"title\":\"Metamorphosis\",\"summary\":\"How I went from knowing nothing about Node.js to running a 90 minute webinar in less than a week\"}},\"next\":{\"html\":\"<h2>Why blog?</h2>\\n<p>I decided to create this blog for three reasons:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>To practice writing and clarify my thinking</strong></p>\\n<p>I've produced very few extended pieces of writing over the past 5 years, in part due to my subject choices at A-Level and Uni. Most would agree that writing is an essential skill to refine, and I think the best way to for me to do that is to cover topics which I'm passionate about.</p>\\n<p>The process of writing things down requires clear thinking, so covering familiar topics will enforce a certain rigor, and perhaps expose some faulty assumptions. Writing a blog post on an unfamiliar topic will be a ideal way to explore, then codify and share my learning.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>To have a public platform where I can share thoughts, experiences, and learning</strong></p>\\n<p>I love the idea that you could read my blog and find something useful, whether it be a tutorial for some new technology or a new technique for learning.</p>\\n<p>I hope that my experiences will reflect yours, and my thinking will resonate with you. If you learn a fraction of what I do through writing the posts I'll judge it a great success!</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>To display and keep a record of all the exciting things I learn about tech</strong></p>\\n<p>One of the things I love about technology is that there is always more to learn. There are endless opportunities to read, practice, and use new concepts every day. It will be a sad day if I ever stop learning, so I strive to explore fresh ideas constantly.</p>\\n<p>While this blog may serve as an impartial record of my journey through life and the tech industry, I hope it will also be useful to demonstrate my passion for technology.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h2>What can you expect from this blog?</h2>\\n<p>At this stage, the exact contents of future posts is still undecided. Everything I write will keep the above principles in mind, so you can expect the majority of posts will be somewhat technology-related. If there's a specific topic you'd like me to cover, please feel free to reach out with suggestions and feedback!</p>\\n<p>I hope the form and tone of my writing will develop into a warmer, more conversational style over the coming months - perhaps it will change drastically as I get a clearer idea of the audience and the writing style I'm most comfortable with.</p>\\n<p>I'm planning to post at least once a month; this seems like a reasonable cadence to ensure I continue to meet the aims above.</p>\\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>\\n<h2>Technical setup - Blog 1.0</h2>\\n<h3>Static site generation</h3>\\n<p>Currently I'm using <a href=\\\"https://gohugo.io/\\\">Hugo</a> to generate a static website. Hugo is a fantastic cross-platform static site generator tool built in Go. I recently dipped my toe into Django too, and I really enjoyed how my knowledge of <a href=\\\"http://handlebarsjs.com/\\\">Handlebars</a> templating  crosses over to both python and Go.</p>\\n<p>I found it incredibly easy to get up and running with a local server, and love how simply running <code>hugo server</code> sets up automatic server restarts when a file changes, and live reload  in the browser every time that happens.</p>\\n<p>I also considered GitHub's offering in this space, <a href=\\\"https://jekyllrb.com/\\\">Jekyll</a>, and to be honest, there wasn't much in it. Hugo's slighly more beginner-friendly docs swung it for me. I'll definitely consider migrating in the future, especially since Jekyll is so closely integrated with GitHub pages. The technical implementation of the blog will evolve along with the writing!</p>\\n<p>Once I've learned more about Hugo I'll probably write a more in-depth post - I'm also hoping to contribute to the project on GitHub in the near future.</p>\\n<h3>Design &#x26; Writing</h3>\\n<p>The look and feel of the blog is currently based on the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/tmaiaroto/hugo-redlounge\\\">hugo-redlounge</a> theme - I made a few simplifications and style modifications (for example adding a picture next to each post), but the structure is largely unedited. Using a theme has been an ideal way to get up and running quickly - I prioritised content creation over having a perfectly styled site. The design will be an iterative process, making small modifications and additions as I go along - look out for updates!</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://typora.io/\\\">Typora</a> is an amazing, minimal Markdown editor for writing posts in the flow, without distractions. The best part is it renders style <strong>as you write</strong>, meaning there is only a single window! All the markdown editors I've used previously have two - one for text entry and one for previewing your document.</p>\\n<h3>Build process &#x26; Hosting</h3>\\n<p>I chose to use <a href=\\\"https://pages.github.com/\\\">GitHub Pages</a> to host this blog initially, mainly due to fact that it's free, but also because Git is a tool I'm very familiar with, Pages integrates seamlessly into my workflow.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://blog.christophvoigt.com/setting-up-hugo-with-github-pages/\\\">This blog post</a> was invaluable in setting up a quick and easy CI process - I simply <code>git push</code> to the 'source' branch of my GitHub pages repository, and thanks to the magic of <a href=\\\"https://travis-ci.org/\\\">Travis CI</a>, my changes are live within ~30 seconds.</p>\\n<p>Overall, hosting and CI was one of the sections that's taken the least work so far, since I was pretty happy with the setup 'out of the box'.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/matt/Documents/code/gatsby-blog-starter-kit/src/pages/2016-10-28-promulgation/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"fileAbsolutePath\":\"/Users/matt/Documents/code/gatsby-blog-starter-kit/src/pages/2016-10-28-promulgation/index.md\",\"timeToRead\":4,\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28T23:17:39Z\",\"path\":\"/promulgation\",\"tags\":[\"react\",\"gatsby\",\"static site\",\"meta\"],\"title\":\"Promulgation\",\"summary\":\"Why I decided to create a blog and how I set it up\"}}}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/assimilation.json\n// module id = ./node_modules/json-loader/index.js!./.cache/json/assimilation.json\n// module chunks = 24"],"sourceRoot":""}
