To summarise, I introduced a new recruitment hackathon stream using Node.js, which increased the number of applications by <strong>25%</strong>. The students using the new platform (all of whom I also mentored), made up <strong>55%</strong> of the candidates invited to interview.</p>\n<p>The junior developer recruitment process at Eli Lilly consists of a week-long online hackathon, followed by on-site interviews. During the time I applied, the development language used for the hack was restricted to Salesforce.com.</p>\n<p>The conversion rate of applicants was fairly low for my intake, with a number of applicants failing to submit at the end of the hackathon. After consideration, and talking to some colleagues who went through this process, I spotted an opportunity to improve the number of applicants and their conversion rate.</p>\n<p>The key issue was the lack of flexibility - Salesforce is a useful platform, and experience with Java can transfer well, but for those with prior experience in web development the limitations could be frustrating. Any new platform added also needed to have a free trial, and be accessible to those with little/no experience.</p>\n<h2>Choosing the platform</h2>\n<p>Node.js on Heroku seemed like a good choice of language and platform due to its plethora of packages (allowing applicants to add complex functionality quickly), wide usage within Lilly (giving us expertise to lean on for judging), and easy integration with other free tools like GitHub.</p>\n<p>A number of tasks had to be completed before offering this application stream to the next set of applicants:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An example application submission to demonstrate the quality of work expected</li>\n<li>Detailed mark scheme / scoring criteria</li>\n<li>Training video(s) to get those with little previous experience up to speed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I therefore decided to simulate the hackathon process end to end using our new framework. This way I could test it out and see if it would be possible for someone who didn\'t know Node to produce something comparable to those choosing the Salesforce path.</p>\n<p>One of our graduate developers who had previous experience with Node created the scoring criteria, and off I went!</p>\n<h2>Learning Node and ideation</h2>\n<p>Step one was to learn Node.js. I collected plenty of resources - software, articles, and tutorials, then began to work through them. One particularly useful tool was <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html">express-generator</a>, which creates a barebones Node.js/Express app filestructure.</p>\n<p>I then had to think of an idea. As part of the hackathon, we provide applicants with some \'challenges\' to help with the ideation phase. These take the form of quite general problems related to healthcare, for example encouraging diabetics to exercise, or distributing food around the world.</p>\n<p>The idea I settled on was to help distribute supplies to those affected by a natural disaster. <a href="https://github.com/mattdean1/quake-supply">Quake-supply</a> intends to track supplies distributed through field outposts after an earthquake.</p>\n<h2>Example submission</h2>\n<p>I created my sample app over a couple of days, learning more about Node along the way.</p>\n<p>I pull live data from the US Geological Survey API to get the coordinates and magnitude of the most recent earthquakes, and use <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet.js</a> for mapping. I also used <a href="http://t4t5.github.io/sweetalert/">SweetAlert</a> and <a href="https://datatables.net/">DataTables</a> to help make it look presentable.</p>\n<p>Once the app was finished, I recorded a <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwAduYXoO8I">video</a></strong> explaining the idea, the app, and how I created it.</p>\n<h2>Webinar</h2>\n<p>I ran a live webinar to give the students more information about the hackathon, show them how to get started on the platform, and give them a chance to ask questions. There was a separate webinar run for the Salesforce stream so for this one I was on my own - after a brief introduction by the sponsor of the program, it was down to me. Here\'s the structure of the content I presented:</p>\n<h4>Tools</h4>\n<p>First, I thought it\'d be a good idea to introduce the students to some of the key tooling and the platform. For this webinar I had to assume they had no previous web development experience, so it was difficult to strike a balance between being high-level and detailed.</p>\n<p>I gave a quick rundown of GitHub, PaaS, Heroku, Atom, and express-generator.</p>\n<h4>CRUD through a todo app</h4>\n<p>Secondly, I introduced the Connect, Request, Update, and Delete operations on a Node/Mongo stack by creating a basic todo app. I generated the file structure using express-generator and explained each folder, then got straight into coding.</p>\n<p>I used a pre-prepared webpage with code snippets (GitHub Gists) so those viewing the webinar could code along live or with the recording. My app was also regularly deployed and live on Heroku throughout the webinar.</p>\n<p>The tutorial was roughly split up into four sections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Setup, first push, importing a CSS framework</li>\n<li>Display Todos, create new Todos</li>\n<li>Add a database</li>\n<li>Delete a todo, tick off a todo</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Scoring and Submission</h4>\n<p>Lastly, I ran through what we were looking for in a successful submission, with particular attention to the format of the submission video.</p>\n<p>I also talked about the scoring criteria and gave my final tips and tricks for succeeding in the hackathon. The webinar ended with Q and A, giving candidates valuable time to clarify anything they didn\'t understand.</p>\n<h4>Result</h4>\n<p>After the webinar, I made available on the Facebook group the list of resources I curated, the Todo app repository, the snippet webpage, and a recording of the entire thing.</p>\n<p>I got great feedback from the applicants and my colleagues, who said it was extremely clear and everything was well explained.</p>\n<h2>Mentoring</h2>\n<p>I was allocated all 6 students who chose to use Node/Heroku to mentor through the process. This consisted of encouraging them via facebook and email, and answering any questions they had about the application process or about the technology. Over the week I supported them as best as I could, and got some positive \'thankyou\' responses, but the real feedback came when it was time for judging.</p>\n<p>Myself, some other developers, and some more technically minded management came together to score the submissions and decide which candidates should be invited on-site for an interview.</p>\n<p>I was unbelievably pleased that my mentees made up <strong>55%</strong> (5 out of 9) of the interview candidates! This is likely due to a combination of factors, but I think their use of the Node/Heroku was key, as it allowed them to quickly create advanced functionality.</p>\n<h2>Continued use of Node.js</h2>\n<p>Learning Node.js was a key milestone in my journey as web developer, and I\'ve gone on to use it in a number of apps at work, also becoming the nominal Node.js consultant for our internal PaaS service.</p>\n<p>Example projects I used it in include: an <a href="https://github.com/mattdean1/nodejs-oidc-client-example">OpenID Connect accelerator</a>, a number of metrics dashboards (in combination with <a href="http://www.chartjs.org/">Chart.js</a>), and <a href="https://github.com/mattdean1/reMINDer">a reminder system for people with Alzheimer\'s</a>.</p>\n<p>I\'m currently learning React and Webpack by using them for a couple of projects in work, and although the outcome may not be as dramatic, I hope to write a post featuring these technologies soon.</p>',timeToRead:5,frontmatter:{date:"January 17, 2017",path:"/metamorphosis",tags:["lilly","nodejs","javascript"],title:"Metamorphosis"}},responsiveImage:{responsiveSizes:{aspectRatio:1.4938271604938271,base64:"data:image/jpeg;base64,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",src:"/blog/static/2efbca5955107c3d0e7a448c8c63e1a5-7da9d.jpg",srcSet:"/blog/static/2efbca5955107c3d0e7a448c8c63e1a5-e49f3.jpg 200w,\n/blog/static/2efbca5955107c3d0e7a448c8c63e1a5-5758d.jpg 400w,\n/blog/static/2efbca5955107c3d0e7a448c8c63e1a5-7da9d.jpg 800w,\n/blog/static/2efbca5955107c3d0e7a448c8c63e1a5-936f0.jpg 1200w,\n/blog/static/2efbca5955107c3d0e7a448c8c63e1a5-13920.jpg 1600w,\n/blog/static/2efbca5955107c3d0e7a448c8c63e1a5-4950d.jpg 2400w,\n/blog/static/2efbca5955107c3d0e7a448c8c63e1a5-aa6db.jpg 3872w",sizes:"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}},pathContext:{prev:{html:'<p>I ran into an interesting bug while taking part in the <a href="https://www.starlingbank.com/">Starling Bank</a> hackathon last weekend - it was a fantastic experience being one of the first to work with an Open Banking API.</p>\n<p>I worked with 3 friends to create an automated savings app which allows you to automatically allocate funds to your savings account based on customisable rules, and track your progress towards savings goals.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/mattdean1/savings-automator">code on GitHub</a>!</p>\n<p>This will be a technical post focused on what caused the bug and how I solved it.

After some extensive googling I found this <a href="https://medium.com/pro-react/a-brief-talk-about-immutability-and-react-s-helpers-70919ab8ae7c">super helpful article</a>.</p>\n<h2>It’s a JS problem</h2>\n<p>Objects and arrays are passed by reference in JS. This means that a new copy is not created, and updating the \'new\' object or array actually modifies the original one.</p>\n<p>In this case I couldn\'t use <code>array.concat</code> or similar non-destructive methods, or <code>object.assign</code> as suggested in the article because I am attempting to modify a nested object so JavaScript will always pass by reference.</p>\n<h2>Immutability helper</h2>\n<p>The article I linked earlier references the built-in React Immutability Helpers, however when I visit the suggested <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/update.html">page in the React docs</a>, I find that "<code>update</code> is a legacy add-on. Use <a href="https://github.com/kolodny/immutability-helper">kolodny/immutability-helper instead</a>."</p>\n<p>This is a fantastic little module that allows us to update e.g. a complicated nested state object "without changing how the data is represented". The syntax is similar to mongodb queries, so didn\'t take long to get used to.</p>\n<p>If you\'re running into issues related to the immutability in more than one place in your application, you might want to look into a more full-featured solution like Facebook\'s <a href="https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/">Immutable.js</a>.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>Remembering to import the library,

As part of my degree, I take a year to out to work, giving me invaluable experience, but also giving me time and space to figure out my ideal career path. In this post I'll talk about the first few weeks there and the process of settling in.</p>\n<p>This is my first entry into the corporate world, previous jobs having been at much smaller companies.</p>\n<p>There was so much take in at the beginning: business skills, information about the company, names and faces - never mind the technology! I feel like a lot of this was tacit knowledge, particularly the unwritten rules and expectations that came with being a new intern.</p>\n<h3>Initial Pressure</h3>\n<p>It didn't help that the student I was replacing, Tom, was one of the best in his cohort. He did an amazing job helping me to find my feet, but hearing him recount his accomplishments often made me think 'how could I ever come close?'.</p>\n<p>A new graduate, Alex, started in our team at the same time as I did. Our skillsets were (are?) quite different, so I don't think we felt too much competition, but there was an unavoidable element of comparison. In hindsight, this was a good thing, because it made me hold myself to a higher standard, but in the early days it added another facet to the pressure!</p>\n<p>One of the scariest things Tom and Alex 'suggested' I do was run a 'lunch and learn' - present a topic of my choice at a lunchtime. The audience was mainly the new students, which was a relief in the way that no higher-ups were there, but of course I didn't want to look like an idiot in from of my peers!</p>\n<p>Looking back, this was probably the single most valuable thing for increasing my confidence, and gaining exposure - thanks guys.</p>\n<h3>Information overload</h3>\n<p>Along with the 'big shoes to fill', there was an vast amount of incoming information. From company mission through departmental responsibilities all the way to individual roles, it was definitely a case of 'death by powerpoint'.</p>\n<p>A big issue was the number of abbreviations and jargon thrown around. Most people probably don't realise they do it, and it certainly speeds up information transfer once everyone knows them, but it increased the initial learning curve dramatically.</p>\n<p>It may not be immediately obvious, but learning so many names and faces at once was also a challenge. With all the other info being fired at me, I sometimes had to ask for introductions more than once.</p>\n<h3>Tech learning curve</h3>\n<p>Fortunately, the tech learning curve wasn't as steep initially - at least in the first week or two. I started off with a fairly simple project - developing an anonymous online forum for employees to raise questions with senior management. I chose to use PHP, since that was the web language I was most familiar with. However, I soon ran into some hurdles - developing behind the corporate proxy was one, working on a windows machine another. It took a while to get my environment set up similar enough to the Macbook I'd been using for the past 5+ years, but thanks to <a href=\"http://cmder.net/\">Cmder</a>, <a href=\"https://atom.io/\">Atom</a> and the <code>http_proxy</code> environment variable I eventually got into the groove.</p>\n<p>I was also blazing a trail with some of my work on OpenShift. A decent part of my role focuses on setting up this internal PaaS as a production service, so I was deploying apps, writing scripts, and integrating with databases - things that our customers wanted but no-one had attempted before. This was amazing fun, but did lead to some days of frustration when the environment was unstable.</p>\n<p>While a large part of my dayjob remained working on OpenShift, I quickly moved on to learn new web technologies and new platforms - check my post where I tell the story of [how I learned Node.js and ran a 90-minute webinar in one week]!</p>\n<h3>Now</h3>\n<p>I'd say it took me 3-4 months to feel fully comfortable in my role, and ramp up to full speed. That isn't to stay I stopped learning - every day brings a fresh challenge.</p>\n<p>Comparing myself now to myself at the start of the year, I'm amazed. My confidence has been vastly increased, my technical abilities have come on in leaps and bounds, and my business skills are also much better. It's been a great year so far, and I think I've built a fantastic foundation to continue learning and growing. Here's to the rest of the year and the future!</p>",id:"/Users/matt/Documents/code/gatsby-blog-starter-kit/src/pages/2016-12-05-assimiliation/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/Users/matt/Documents/code/gatsby-blog-starter-kit/src/pages/2016-12-05-assimiliation/index.md",timeToRead:3,frontmatter:{date:"2016-12-05T13:35:13.234Z",path:"/assimilation",tags:["placement","lilly"],title:"Assimilation",summary:"Entering a Fortune 500 company and the corporate world"}}}}}});
